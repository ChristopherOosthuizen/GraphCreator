      "['From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia', 'Contents', 'List of Tour de France general classification winners', '\\n', 'The Tour de France is an annual road bicycle race held over 23\\xa0days in July. Established in 1903 by newspaper L\\'Auto, the Tour is the best-known and most prestigious of cycling\\'s three \"Grand Tours\"; the others are the Giro d\\'Italia and the Vuelta a España.[1] The race usually covers approximately 3,500 kilometres (2,200\\xa0mi), passing through France and neighbouring countries such as Belgium.[2] The race is broken into day-long stages. Individual finishing times for each stage are totalled to determine the overall winner at the end of the race. The course changes every year, but has always finished in Paris; since 1975, it has finished along the Champs-Élysées.[3]\\n', 'The rider with the lowest aggregate time at the end of each day wears the yellow jersey, representing the leader of the general classification. There are other jerseys as well: the green jersey, worn by the leader of the points classification; the polka dot jersey, worn by the leader of the mountains classification; and the white jersey, worn by the leader of the young rider classification.[4]\\n', 'Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, and Miguel Indurain, have won the most Tours with five each. Indurain is the only man to win five consecutive Tours. Henri Cornet is the youngest winner; he won in 1904, just short of his 20th birthday. Firmin Lambot is the oldest winner, he was 36\\xa0years, 4\\xa0months old when he won in 1922.[5] French cyclists have won the most Tours; 21 cyclists have won 36\\xa0Tours among them. Belgian cyclists are second with 18\\xa0victories, and Spanish riders are third with 12\\xa0wins.[6] The most recent winner is Danish rider Jonas Vingegaard, who won the 2023 Tour.[7]\\n', 'After it emerged that Lance Armstrong had used performance-enhancing drugs, in October 2012, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) stripped Armstrong of the seven consecutive Tour general classification titles between 1999 and 2005.[8][9]\\n', 'History[edit]', \"The Tour de France was established in 1903 by the newspaper L'Auto, in an attempt to increase its sales. The first race was won by Frenchman Maurice Garin. He won again the next year, but was disqualified after allegations that he had been transported by car or rail arose. Henri Cornet became the winner after the dispute was settled; he is the youngest to win the Tour. Following the scandals in 1904, the scoring system was changed from being time-based to a point-based system, in which the cyclist who has the fewest points at the end of the race is victorious. This system lasted until 1912, when the time-based system was re-introduced. French cyclists were successful in the early Tours; the first non-Frenchman to win the Tour was François Faber of Luxembourg, who won in 1909.[10]\\n\", 'Belgian riders were more successful before and after the First World War (which suspended the Tour from 1915 to 1918). In the 1920s, trade teams dominated the Tour; cyclists such as Nicolas Frantz won the Tour with the Alcyon team. However, when Alcyon cyclist Maurice De Waele won the Tour in 1929 while ill, the organisers decided to introduce national teams the following year, to stop team tactics from undermining the race. Because of the Second World War, the Tour de France was suspended from 1940 to 1946.[11]\\n', \"After the Second World War, no one dominated the Tour until Louison Bobet, who won three consecutive Tours from 1953 to 1955—he was the first person to achieve this feat.[12] This was bettered by the French cyclist Jacques Anquetil, who won four successive Tours from 1961 to 1964. Anquetil, who also won in 1957, became the first to win five Tours.[13] Anquetil's five victories were matched when Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx won four successive Tours from 1969 to 1972 and the 1974 Tour. Merckx is the only person to have won the general, points and king of the mountains classifications in the same Tour. He achieved this in 1969, when he won his first Tour.[14]\\n\", 'Merckx looked to be heading for a record sixth Tour victory in 1975, but Bernard Thévenet beat him, becoming the first French winner in seven years. Thévenet won again in 1977; however, he was eclipsed in following years by fellow Frenchman Bernard Hinault, who won consecutive Tours in 1978 and 1979. Hinault won the Tour at his first attempt in 1978; becoming one of 11 cyclists (including Anquetil, Merckx, Hugo Koblet and Fausto Coppi) managed to do so.[15] In 1980, Hinault was going for a third consecutive win, but had to pull out because of tendinitis, and the Tour was won by Joop Zoetemelk.[16] Hinault returned in 1981 and won that race as well as the one after that. Hinault sat out the Tour in 1983, and another Frenchman—Laurent Fignon—achieved victory. Fignon won again the following year, beating Hinault; Hinault recovered in 1985 to win his fifth Tour.\\n', \"American Greg LeMond became the first non-European to win the Tour in 1986. LeMond missed out in 1987 and 1988, but returned in 1989 to win the Tour by finishing eight seconds ahead of Laurent Fignon, the smallest winning margin in the Tour's history. LeMond also won in 1990.[17] In 1991, Spaniard Miguel Indurain won his first Tour. Indurain came to dominate the Tour, winning four more Tours consecutively—making him the first person to win five consecutive Tours.[18] He tried to win a record-high sixth Tour in 1996, but was beaten by Bjarne Riis, who later admitted to using Erythropoietin.[19] Jan Ullrich and Marco Pantani won in 1997 and 1998, respectively; however, Pantani's victory was overshadowed by doping scandals.[20]\\n\", 'The 1999 Tour saw the first victory of Lance Armstrong,[21] which was followed by six more, for a total of seven consecutive victories.[22] He was later stripped of his titles in October 2012, when it emerged he had used performance-enhancing drugs throughout much of his career, including the Tour de France victories.[9] Floyd Landis won the Tour in 2006, but was later stripped of his title, after a drug-control test demonstrated the presence of a skewed testosterone/epitestosterone ratio.[23] Óscar Pereiro was subsequently awarded the victory. Alberto Contador won the 2007 Tour with the Discovery Channel. The 2007 Tour was also marred by doping scandals, thus Contador was unable to defend his title in 2008, as his Astana team was banned for its part in the controversy. Fellow Spaniard Carlos Sastre of Team CSC won.[24] Contador and Astana returned in 2009 to regain the title. He won the Tour again in 2010, but was later stripped of his title after he was found guilty of doping. Runner-up Andy Schleck was awarded the victory.\\n', \"Cadel Evans became the first Australian to win the Tour in 2011.[25] The following year, Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist to win the Tour.[26] Chris Froome became the second successive British winner in 2013, which was the 100th edition of the race.[27] He could not defend his title the following year, as he crashed out in stage 5, with Vincenzo Nibali winning his first Tour.[28] Froome regained the title in 2015 and then successfully defended it in 2016, the first rider in over 20 years to do so.[29] Froome won the Tour for a third consecutive year in 2017.[30] He was unsuccessful in his attempts to win a fourth Tour in succession in 2018 edition, Froome's teammate, Geraint Thomas, was the winner instead.[31] Thomas was unable to win for a second year in succession in 2019. He finished second behind his teammate Egan Bernal, who became the first Colombian cyclist to win the Tour.[32]\\n\", \"The 2020 Tour was postponed to commence on 29 August, following the French government's extension of a ban on mass gatherings after the worldwide COVID-19 outbreak.[33] This was the first time since the end of World War II that the Tour de France was not held in the month of July.[34] It was won by Tadej Pogačar, who became the first Slovenian rider to win the race as well as one of the youngest winners in Tour history. He repeated as champion in the 2021 edition. The following year, Jonas Vingegaard became the first Danish rider since 1996 to win the race. Vingegaard won again the following year; he won the 2023 edition by 7 minutes and 29 seconds from Pogačar.[7]\\n\", 'Winners[edit]', 'Multiple winners[edit]', 'The following riders have won the Tour de France on more than one occasion.\\n', 'Alberto Contador won three Tours, but was stripped of one following an anti-doping violation.[D]\\n', 'Lance Armstrong was removed from the head of the list after having all seven of his Tour victories stripped when he was found guilty of repeated doping offences. \\n', 'By nationality[edit]', 'See also[edit]', 'Footnotes[edit]', '\\n^ Henri Cornet was declared the winner of the 1904 Tour de France after the disqualification of Maurice Garin for cheating.[37]\\n\\n^ Bjarne Riis admitted to doping during the 1996 Tour de France. The organizers of the Tour de France stated that they no longer consider him to be the winner, although Union Cycliste Internationale has so far refused to change the official status owing to the amount of time that has passed since his win. Jan Ullrich was placed second on the podium in Paris.[38]\\n\\n^ a b c d e f g Lance Armstrong was declared winner of seven consecutive Tours from 1999 to 2005. However, in October 2012, he was stripped of all titles by the UCI owing to his use of performance-enhancing drugs. The Tour director Christian Prudhomme had previously declared that if this happened, there would be no alternative winners for those years, but this has not yet been made official.[39]\\n\\n^ Floyd Landis was the winner at the podium ceremony in Paris on the last day of the 2006 Tour, but subsequently was found to have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during stage 17 of the race. The United States Anti-Doping Agency found him guilty of using synthetic testosterone during the race and stripped him of his title on 20 September 2007.[40]\\n\\n^ Alberto Contador was the winner at the podium ceremony in Paris on the last day of the 2010 Tour, but subsequently was found to have tested positive for the prohibited substance clenbuterol on a rest day. The Court of Arbitration for Sport found him guilty of using clenbuterol during the race and stripped him of his title on 6 February 2012.[41]\\n\\n', 'References[edit]', '\\n^ FAQ.

      "['From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia', 'Contents', 'International Mathematical Olympiad', '\\n', 'The International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is a mathematical olympiad for pre-university students, and is the oldest of the International Science Olympiads.[1] It is “the most prestigious” mathematical competition in the world. The first IMO was held in Romania in 1959. It has since been held annually, except in 1980. More than 100 countries participate. Each country sends a team of up to six students,[2] plus one team leader, one deputy leader, and observers.[3]\\n', 'The content ranges from extremely difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems to problems in branches of mathematics not conventionally covered in secondary or high school and often not at university level either, such as projective and complex geometry, functional equations, combinatorics, and well-grounded number theory, of which extensive knowledge of theorems is required. Calculus, though allowed in solutions, is never required, as there is a principle that anyone with a basic understanding of mathematics should understand the problems, even if the solutions require a great deal more knowledge. Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant, deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity, often times a great deal of ingenuity to net all points for a given IMO problem.\\n', 'The selection process differs by country, but it often consists of a series of tests which admit fewer students at each progressing test. Awards are given to approximately the top-scoring 50% of the individual contestants. Teams are not officially recognized—all scores are given only to individual contestants, but team scoring is unofficially compared more than individual scores.[4] Contestants must be under the age of 20 and must not be registered at any tertiary institution. Subject to these conditions, an individual may participate any number of times in the IMO.[5]\\n', 'History[edit]', 'The first IMO was held in Romania in 1959. Since then it has been held every year (except in 1980, when it was cancelled due to internal strife in Mongolia)[6] It was initially founded for eastern European member countries of the Warsaw Pact, under the USSR bloc of influence, but later other countries participated as well.[2] Because of this eastern origin, the IMOs were first hosted only in eastern European countries, and gradually spread to other nations.[7]\\n', 'Sources differ about the cities hosting some of the early IMOs. This may be partly because leaders and students are generally housed at different locations, and partly because after the competition the students were sometimes based in multiple cities for the rest of the IMO. The exact dates cited may also differ, because of leaders arriving before the students, and at more recent IMOs the IMO Advisory Board arriving before the leaders.[8]\\n', 'Several students, such as Lisa Sauermann, Reid W. Barton, Nicușor Dan and Ciprian Manolescu have performed exceptionally well in the IMO, winning multiple gold medals. Others, such as Terence Tao, Artur Avila, Grigori Perelman, Ngô Bảo Châu and Maryam Mirzakhani have gone on to become notable mathematicians. Several former participants have won awards such as the Fields Medal.[9]\\n', 'Scoring and format[edit]', \"The competition consists of 6 problems. The competition is held over two consecutive days with 3 problems each; each day the contestants have four-and-a-half hours to solve three problems. Each problem is worth 7 points for a maximum total score of 42 points. Calculators are not allowed. Protractors are not allowed relatively recently.[10] Unlike other science olympiads, the IMO has no official syllabus and does not cover any university-level topics. The problems chosen are from various areas of secondary school mathematics, broadly classifiable as geometry, number theory, algebra, and combinatorics. They require no knowledge of higher mathematics such as calculus and analysis, and solutions are often elementary. However, they are usually disguised so as to make the solutions difficult. The problems given in the IMO are largely designed to require creativity and the ability to solve problems quickly. Thus, the prominently featured problems are algebraic inequalities, complex numbers, and construction-oriented geometrical problems, though in recent years, the latter has not been as popular as before because of the algorithmic use of theorems like Muirhead's Inequality, and Complex/Analytic Bash to solve problems.[11]\\n\", 'Each participating country, other than the host country, may submit suggested problems to a Problem Selection Committee provided by the host country, which reduces the submitted problems to a shortlist. The team leaders arrive at the IMO a few days in advance of the contestants and form the IMO Jury which is responsible for all the formal decisions relating to the contest, starting with selecting the six problems from the shortlist. The Jury aims to order the problems so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1, Q4, Q2, Q5, Q3 and Q6, where the First day problems Q1, Q2, and Q3 are in increasing difficulty, and the Second day problems Q4, Q5, Q6 are in increasing difficulty. The team leaders of all countries are given the problems in advance of the contestants, and thus, are kept strictly separated and observed.[12]\\n', \"Each country's marks are agreed between that country's leader and deputy leader and coordinators provided by the host country (the leader of the team whose country submitted the problem in the case of the marks of the host country), subject to the decisions of the chief coordinator and ultimately a jury if any disputes cannot be resolved.[13]\\n\", 'Selection process[edit]', 'The selection process for the IMO varies greatly by country. In some countries, especially those in East Asia, the selection process involves several tests of a difficulty comparable to the IMO itself.[14] The Chinese contestants go through a camp.[15] In others, such as the United States, possible participants go through a series of easier standalone competitions that gradually increase in difficulty. In the United States, the tests include the American Mathematics Competitions, the American Invitational Mathematics Examination, and the United States of America Junior Mathematical Olympiad/United States of America Mathematical Olympiad, each of which is a competition in its own right. For high scorers in the final competition for the team selection, there also is a summer camp, like that of China.[16]\\n', 'In countries of the former Soviet Union and other eastern European countries, a team has in the past been chosen several years beforehand, and they are given special training specifically for the event. However, such methods have been discontinued in some countries.[17]\\n', 'Awards[edit]', 'The participants are ranked based on their individual scores. Medals are awarded to the highest ranked participants; slightly fewer than half of them receive a medal. The cutoffs (minimum scores required to receive a gold, silver, or bronze medal respectively) are then chosen so that the numbers of gold, silver and bronze medals awarded are approximately in the ratios 1:2:3. Participants who do not win a medal but who score 7 points on at least one problem receive an honorable mention.[18]\\n', 'Special prizes may be awarded for solutions of outstanding elegance or involving good generalisations of a problem. This last happened in 1995 (Nikolay Nikolov, Bulgaria) and 2005 (Iurie Boreico), but was more frequent up to the early 1980s.[19] The special prize in 2005 was awarded to Iurie Boreico, a student from Moldova, for his solution to Problem 3, a three variable inequality.\\n', 'The rule that at most half the contestants win a medal is sometimes broken if it would cause the total number of medals to deviate too much from half the number of contestants. This last happened in 2010 (when the choice was to give either 226 (43.71%) or 266 (51.45%) of the 517 contestants (excluding the 6 from North Korea — see below) a medal),[20] 2012 (when the choice was to give either 226 (41.24%) or 277 (50.55%) of the 548 contestants a medal), and 2013, when the choice was to give either 249 (47.16%) or 278 (52.65%) of the 528 contestants a medal. In these cases, slightly more than half the contestants were awarded a medal.[21][22]\\n', 'Penalties and bans[edit]', \"North Korea was disqualified twice for cheating, once at the 32nd IMO in 1991[23] and again at the 51st IMO in 2010.[24] However, the incident in 2010 was controversial.[25][26] There have been other cases of cheating where contestants received penalties, although these cases were not officially disclosed. (For instance, at the 34th IMO in 1993, a contestant was disqualified for bringing a pocket book of formulas, and two contestants were awarded zero points on second day's paper for bringing calculators.[27])\\n\", 'Russia has been banned from participating in the Olympiad since 2022 as a response to its invasion of Ukraine.[28] Nonetheless, a limited number of students (specifically, 6) were allowed to take part in the competition, but only remotely and with their results being excluded from the medal tally.[28] There has not been other country being banned yet on similar ground.\\n', 'Summary[edit]', 'Notable achievements[edit]', 'The following nations have achieved the highest team score in the respective competition:\\n', 'The following nations have achieved an all-members-gold IMO with a full team:\\n', \"The only countries to have their entire team score perfectly in the IMO were the United States in 1994, China in 2022, and Luxembourg, whose 1-member team had a perfect score in 1981. The US's success earned a mention in TIME Magazine.[84] Hungary won IMO 1975 in an unorthodox way when none of the eight team members received a gold medal (five silver, three bronze).[76] Second place team East Germany also did not have a single gold medal winner (four silver, four bronze).[82]\\n\", \"Several individuals have consistently scored highly and/or earned medals on the IMO: Zhuo Qun Song (Canada) is the most highly decorated participant[85] with five gold medals (including one perfect score in 2015) and one bronze medal.[86] Reid Barton (United States) was the first participant to win a gold medal four times (1998–2001).[87] Barton is also one of only eight four-time Putnam Fellows (2001–04). Christian Reiher (Germany), Lisa Sauermann (Germany), Teodor von Burg (Serbia), Nipun Pitimanaaree (Thailand) and Luke Robitaille (United States) are the only other participants to have won four gold medals (2000–03, 2008–11, 2009–12, 2010–13, 2011–14, and 2019–22 respectively); Reiher also received a bronze medal (1999), Sauermann a silver medal (2007), von Burg a silver medal (2008) and a bronze medal (2007), and Pitimanaaree a silver medal (2009).[88] Wolfgang Burmeister (East Germany), Martin Härterich (West Germany), Iurie Boreico (Moldova), and Lim Jeck (Singapore) are the only other participants besides Reiher, Sauermann, von Burg, and Pitimanaaree to win five medals with at least three of them gold.[2] Ciprian Manolescu (Romania) managed to write a perfect paper (42 points) for gold medal more times than anybody else in the history of the competition, doing it all three times he participated in the IMO (1995, 1996, 1997).[89] Manolescu is also a three-time Putnam Fellow (1997, 1998, 2000).[90] Eugenia Malinnikova (Soviet Union) is the highest-scoring female contestant in IMO history. She has 3 gold medals in IMO 1989 (41 points), IMO 1990 (42) and IMO 1991 (42), missing only 1 point in 1989 to precede Manolescu's achievement.[91]\\n\", 'Terence Tao (Australia) participated in IMO 1986, 1987 and 1988, winning bronze, silver and gold medals respectively. He won a gold medal when he just turned thirteen in IMO 1988, becoming the youngest person[92] to receive a gold medal (Zhuo Qun Song of Canada also won a gold medal at age 13, in 2011, though he was older than Tao). Tao also holds the distinction of being the youngest medalist with his 1986 bronze medal, followed by 2009 bronze medalist Raúl Chávez Sarmiento (Peru), at the age of 10 and 11 respectively.[93] Representing the United States, Noam Elkies won a gold medal with a perfect paper at the age of 14 in 1981. Both Elkies and Tao could have participated in the IMO multiple times following their success, but entered university and therefore became ineligible.\\n', 'Medals (1959–2023)[edit]', 'The current ten countries with the best all-time results are as follows:[94]\\n', \"Gender gap and the launch of European Girls' Mathematical Olympiad[edit]\", 'Over the years, since its inception to present, the IMO has attracted far more male contestants than female contestants.[95][96][97] During the period 2000–2021, there were only 1,102 female contestants (9.2%) out of a total of 11,950 contestants. The gap is even more significant in terms of IMO gold medallists; from 1959 to 2021, there were 43 female and 1295 male gold medal winners.[98]\\n', \"This gender gap in participation and in performance at the IMO level led to the establishment of the European Girls' Mathematical Olympiad (EGMO).[99]\\n\", 'Media coverage[edit]', 'See also[edit]', 'Notes[edit]', '\\n^ IMO 2021 was originally to be held in Washington D.C., US, but the US was forced to give up hosting soon after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused funding problems. Russia agreed to host for the second time in a row.[63]\\n\\n^ The originally determined location for hosting IMO 2024 was Ukraine. Due to the recent conflicts between the country and Russia, the location was changed to Bath, in which IMO 2019 was hosted.[68]\\n\\n^ The Soviet Union participated the IMO for the last time in 1991 due to the Dissolution of the Soviet Union.

The symptoms of the allergic reaction may range from mild to severe. They may include itchiness, swelling of the tongue, vomiting, diarrhea, hives, trouble breathing, or low blood pressure. This typically occurs within minutes to several hours of exposure. When the symptoms are severe, it is known as anaphylaxis.[1] A food intolerance and food poisoning are separate conditions, not due to an immune response.[1][4]\\n', \"Common foods involved include cow's milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy, wheat, and sesame.[1][5][2][6] The common allergies vary depending on the country.[1] Risk factors include a family history of allergies, vitamin D deficiency, obesity, and high levels of cleanliness.[1][2] Allergies occur when immunoglobulin E (IgE), part of the body's immune system, binds to food molecules.[1] A protein in the food is usually the problem.[2] This triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine.[1] Diagnosis is usually based on a medical history, elimination diet, skin prick test, blood tests for food-specific IgE antibodies, or oral food challenge.[1][2]\\n\", 'Management involves avoiding the food in question and having a plan if exposure occurs.[2] This plan may include giving adrenaline (epinephrine) and wearing medical alert jewelry.[1] Early childhood exposure to potential allergens may be protective against later development of a food allergy.[2][3] The benefits of allergen immunotherapy for treating food allergies are not proven, thus not recommended as of 2015[update].[7] Some types of food allergies among children resolve with age, including those to milk, eggs, and soy; while others such as to nuts and shellfish typically do not.[2]\\n', 'In the developed world, about 4% to 8% of people have at least one food allergy.[1][2] They are more common in children than adults and appear to be increasing in frequency.[2] Male children appear to be more commonly affected than females.[2] Some allergies more commonly develop early in life, while others typically develop in later life.[1] In developed countries, more people believe they have food allergies when they actually do not have them.[8][9][10]\\n', 'Signs and symptoms[edit]', 'Food allergy symptoms occur within minutes to hours after exposure and may include:[11]\\n', 'In some cases, however, onset of symptoms may be delayed for hours.[11]\\n', 'Symptoms can vary. The amount of food needed to trigger a reaction also varies.[12]\\n', 'Serious danger regarding allergies can begin when the respiratory tract or blood circulation is affected. The former can be indicated through wheezing and cyanosis. Poor blood circulation leads to a weak pulse, pale skin and fainting.[13]\\n', 'A severe case of an allergic reaction, caused by symptoms affecting the respiratory tract and blood circulation, is called anaphylaxis.  When symptoms are related to a drop in blood pressure, the person is said to be in anaphylactic shock. Anaphylaxis occurs when IgE antibodies are involved, and areas of the body that are not in direct contact with the food become affected and show symptoms.[14] Those with asthma or an allergy to peanuts, tree nuts, or seafood are at greater risk for anaphylaxis.\\n', 'Causes[edit]', 'Common food allergies[edit]', 'Allergic reactions are abnormal immune responses that develop after exposure to a given food allergen.[15] Food allergens account for about 90% of all allergic reactions.[16] The most common food allergens include milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat,[17] which are referred to as \"the big eight\", and are required by US law to be on labels of foods that contain those foods.[18] In April 2021, President Biden signed the FASTER Act into law. This recognized sesame as the ninth US mandatory food label allergen.[19][20]\\n', 'Peanuts, a member of the legume family, are one of the most common food allergens that induce reactions in both children and adults.[21] Affecting about 2% of the Western population, peanut allergies tend to cause more severe reactions and anaphylaxis than other food allergies.[22] Tree nuts, including almonds, brazil nuts, cashews, coconuts, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pistachios, pine nuts, and walnuts, are also common allergens. Affected individuals may be sensitive to one particular tree nut or many different ones.[23] Peanuts and seeds, including sesame seeds and poppy seeds, can be processed to extract oils, but trace amounts of protein may also elicit an allergic reaction.[23] Peanut and tree nut allergies are lifelong conditions for the majority of those affected, although evidence shows that ~20% of those with peanut allergies and 9% of those with tree nut allergies may outgrow them.[24]\\n', 'Egg allergies affect about one in 50 children but are frequently outgrown when children reach age five.[25] Affected individuals can be sensitive to proteins both in the egg white and egg yolk, but most children are allergic to those in the white while most adults are allergic to those in the yolk.[26]\\n', \"Cow's milk is the most common food allergen in infants and young children, yet many adults are also sensitized to cow's milk.[27] Many affected individuals cannot tolerate dairy products such as cheese and yogurt.[28] A small portion of children with milk allergy, roughly 10%, have a reaction to beef because it contains small amounts of protein that are also present in cow's milk.[29]\\n\", 'Shellfish, which are divided into crustaceans (shrimp, crab, lobster, etc.) and mollusks (mussel, oyster, scallop, squid, octopus, snail, etc.), are the most common food allergy in adults.[30] People may be allergic to other types of seafood, such as fish.[31] Fish allergies were found to be more common in countries that have high fish consumption compared to those with lower consumption.[32]\\n', 'Other common food allergens include soy and wheat.[33] Those allergic to wheat may be sensitized to any protein in the wheat kernel.[34] To a lesser frequency, people may be mildly allergic to raw fruits and vegetables, a disease known as oral allergy syndrome.[33] Less common allergens include maize, spices, synthetic and natural colors,[35] and chemical additives.[36]\\n', 'Balsam of Peru, which is in various foods, is in the \"top five\" allergens most commonly causing patch test reactions in people referred to dermatology clinics.[37]', 'Routes of exposure[edit]', 'Exposure to certain food proteins triggers the production of antigen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which, if unaccompanied by allergic symptoms, is known as allergic sensitization.[38] Oral ingestion is the main sensitization route for most food allergy cases, yet other routes of exposure include inhalation and skin contact.[39][34]\\n', 'For example, inhaling airborne particles in a farm-scale or factory-scale peanut shelling/crushing environment, or from cooking, can induce respiratory effects in allergic individuals.[40] Furthermore, peanut allergies are much more common in adults who had oozing and crusted skin rashes as infants,[41] suggesting that impaired skin may be a risk factor for sensitization.[34][42] An estimated 28.5 million people worldwide are engaged in the seafood industry, which includes fishing, aquaculture, processing and industrial cooking.[43] In these occupational settings, individuals with fish and shellfish allergies are at high risk of exposure to allergenic proteins via aerosolization.[44][43] Respiratory symptoms may be induced by inhalation of wet aerosols from fresh fish handling, inhalation of dry aerosols from fishmeal processing, and dermal contact through skin breaks and cuts.[45][43] Another occupational food allergy that involves respiratory symptoms is \"baker\\'s asthma,\" which commonly develops in food service workers who work with baked goods.[46] Previous studies detected 40 allergens from wheat, some cross-reacted with rye proteins and a few cross-reacted with grass pollens.[47]\\n', 'Allergic sensitization can occur via skin antigen exposure, which usually manifests as hives.[48] The skin has been suggested to be a critical sensitization route for peanut-allergic individuals.[49][40] Peanut allergies are much more common in adults who had oozing and crusted skin rashes as infants,[41] reinforcing that those with disrupted epithelial barriers, notably the skin barrier, are more prone to skin sensitization.[34] Environmental factors, such as exposure to food, microorganisms, creams, and detergents, may lead to skin barrier dysfunction.[50] Several studies reveal that children exposed to skin creams containing peanut oil are reported to have a higher risk of peanut allergy,[50] suggesting that impaired skin may be a risk factor for sensitization.[34][42]\\n', 'Atopy[edit]', 'Food allergies develop more easily in people with the atopic syndrome, a very common combination of diseases: allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, eczema, and asthma.[51] The syndrome has a strong inherited component; a family history of allergic diseases can be indicative of the atopic syndrome.[medical citation needed]\\n', 'Cross-reactivity[edit]', \"Some children who are allergic to cow's milk protein also show a cross-sensitivity to soy-based products.[52] Some infant formulas have their milk and soy proteins hydrolyzed, so when taken by infants, their immune systems do not recognize the allergen and they can safely consume the product. Hypoallergenic infant formulas can be based on proteins partially predigested to a less antigenic form. Other formulas, based on free amino acids, are the least antigenic and provide complete nutritional support in severe forms of milk allergy.[53]\\n\", 'Crustaceans (shrimp, crab, lobster, etc.) and molluscs (mussel, oyster, scallop, squid, octopus, snail, etc.) are different invertebrate classes, but the allergenic protein tropomyosin is present and responsible for cross-reactivity.[54]\\n', 'People with latex allergy often also develop allergies to bananas, kiwifruit, avocados, and some other foods.[55]\\n', 'Pathophysiology[edit]', 'Conditions caused by food allergies are classified into three groups according to the mechanism of the allergic response:[56]\\n', 'IgE-mediated (classic)\\xa0– the most common type, occurs shortly after eating and may involve anaphylaxis.\\nNon-IgE mediated\\xa0– characterized by an immune response not involving immunoglobulin E; may occur some hours after eating, complicating diagnosis\\nIgE and/or non-IgE-mediated\\xa0– a hybrid of the above two types', \"Allergic reactions are abnormal immune responses to certain substances that are normally harmless. When immune cells encounter the allergenic protein, IgE antibodies are produced; this is similar to the immune system's reaction to foreign pathogens. The IgE antibodies identify the allergenic proteins as harmful and initiate the allergic reaction. The harmful proteins are those that do not break down due to the strong bonds of the protein. IgE antibodies bind to a receptor on the surface of the protein, creating a tag, just as a virus or parasite becomes tagged. Why some proteins do not denature and subsequently trigger allergic reactions and hypersensitivity while others do is not entirely clear.[57]\\n\", 'Hypersensitivities are categorized according to the parts of the immune system that are attacked and the amount of time it takes for the response to occur.  The four types of hypersensitivity reaction are:  type 1, immediate IgE-mediated; type 2, cytotoxic; type 3, immune complex-mediated; and type 4, delayed cell-mediated.[58] The pathophysiology of allergic responses can be divided into two phases. The first is an acute response that occurs immediately after exposure to an allergen. This phase can either subside or progress into a \"late-phase reaction\" which can substantially prolong the symptoms of a response, and result in tissue damage.[citation needed]\\n', 'Many food allergies are caused by hypersensitivities to particular proteins in different foods.  Proteins have unique properties that allow them to become allergens, such as stabilizing forces in their tertiary and quaternary structures which prevent degradation during digestion. Many theoretically allergenic proteins cannot survive the destructive environment of the digestive tract, thus do not trigger hypersensitive reactions.[59]\\n', 'Acute response[edit]', 'In the early stages of allergy, a type I hypersensitivity reaction against an allergen, encountered for the first time, causes a response in a type of immune cell called a TH2 lymphocyte, which belongs to a subset of T cells that produce a cytokine called interleukin-4 (IL-4).  These TH2 cells interact with other lymphocytes called B cells, whose role is the production of antibodies.  Coupled with signals provided by IL-4, this interaction stimulates the B cell to begin production of a large amount of a particular type of antibody known as IgE.  Secreted IgE circulates in the blood and binds to an IgE-specific receptor (a kind of Fc receptor called FcεRI) on the surface of other kinds of immune cells called mast cells and basophils, which are both involved in the acute inflammatory response.  The IgE-coated cells, at this stage, are sensitized to the allergen.[60]\\n', 'If later exposure to the same allergen occurs, the allergen can bind to the IgE molecules held on the surface of the mast cells or basophils.  Cross-linking of the IgE and Fc receptors occurs when more than one IgE-receptor complex interacts with the same allergenic molecule and activates the sensitized cell.  Activated mast cells and basophils undergo a process called degranulation, during which they release histamine and other inflammatory chemical mediators (cytokines, interleukins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins) from their granules into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects, such as vasodilation, mucous secretion, nerve stimulation, and smooth-muscle contraction. This results in rhinorrhea, itchiness, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis. Depending on the individual, the allergen, and the mode of introduction, the symptoms can be system-wide (classical anaphylaxis), or localized to particular body systems.[60]\\n', 'Late-phase response[edit]', 'After the chemical mediators of the acute response subside, late-phase responses can often occur due to the migration of other leukocytes such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and macrophages to the initial site. The reaction is usually seen 2–24 hours after the original reaction.[61] Cytokines from mast cells may also play a role in the persistence of long-term effects.[62]\\n', 'Diagnosis[edit]', 'Diagnosis is usually based on a medical history, elimination diet, skin prick test, blood tests for food-specific IgE antibodies, or oral food challenge.[1][2]\\n', 'Skin-prick testing is easy to do and results are available in minutes. Different allergists may use different devices for testing. Some use a \"bifurcated needle\", which looks like a fork with two prongs. Others use a \"multitest\", which may look like a small board with several pins sticking out of it. In these tests, a tiny amount of the suspected allergen is put onto the skin or into a testing device, and the device is placed on the skin to prick, or break through, the top layer of skin. This puts a small amount of the allergen under the skin. A hive will form at any spot where the person is allergic. This test generally yields a positive or negative result. It is good for quickly learning if a person is allergic to a particular food or not because it detects IgE. Skin tests cannot predict if a reaction would occur or what kind of reaction might occur if a person ingests that particular allergen. They can, however, confirm an allergy in light of a patient\\'s history of reactions to a particular food. Non-IgE-mediated allergies cannot be detected by this method.\\n', 'A CAP-RAST has greater specificity than RAST; it can show the amount of IgE present to each allergen.[68] Researchers have been able to determine \"predictive values\" for certain foods, which can be compared to the RAST results. If a person\\'s RAST score is higher than the predictive value for that food, over a 95% chance exists that patients will have an allergic reaction (limited to rash and anaphylaxis reactions) if they ingest that food. [citation needed] Currently,[when?] predictive values are available for milk, egg, peanut, fish, soy, and wheat.[69][70][71] Blood tests allow for hundreds of allergens to be screened from a single sample, and cover food allergies as well as inhalants. However, non-IgE-mediated allergies cannot be detected by this method. Other widely promoted tests such as the antigen leukocyte cellular antibody test and the food allergy profile are considered unproven methods, the use of which is not advised.[72]\\n', 'Food challenges, especially double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges, are the gold standard for diagnosis of food allergies, including most non-IgE-mediated reactions, but is rarely done.[74] Blind food challenges involve packaging the suspected allergen into a capsule, giving it to the patient, and observing the patient for signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction.[medical citation needed]\\n', \"The recommended method for diagnosing food allergy is to be assessed by an allergist. The allergist will review the patient's history and the symptoms or reactions that have been noted after food ingestion. If the allergist feels the symptoms or reactions are consistent with food allergy, he/she will perform allergy tests. Additional diagnostic tools for evaluation of eosinophilic or non-IgE mediated reactions include endoscopy, colonoscopy, and biopsy.[medical citation needed]\\n\", 'Differential diagnosis[edit]', 'Important differential diagnoses are:\\n', 'Prevention[edit]', \"Breastfeeding for more than four months may prevent atopic dermatitis, cow's milk allergy, and wheezing in early childhood.[78] Early exposure to potential allergens may be protective.[2] Specifically, early exposure to eggs and peanuts reduces the risk of allergies to these.[3] Guidelines suggest introducing peanuts as early as 4–6 months and include precautionary measures for high-risk infants.[79] The former guidelines, advising delaying the introduction of peanuts, are now[when?] thought to have contributed to the increase in peanut allergy seen recently.[80][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed]\\n\", 'To avoid an allergic reaction, a strict diet can be followed. It is difficult to determine the amount of allergenic food required to elicit a reaction, so complete avoidance should be attempted.  In some cases, hypersensitive reactions can be triggered by exposures to allergens through skin contact, inhalation, kissing, participation in sports, blood transfusions, cosmetics, and alcohol.[81]\\n', 'Early introduction of peanut and egg alongside other solids, or by one year of age, may help prevent development of food allergy. Introduction of these allergenic foods within the first year of life appears to be safe. A window of opportunity for the introduction of different food allergens may exist, such as egg introduction ahead of peanut.[82]\\n', 'Inhalation exposure[edit]', \"Allergic reactions to airborne particles or vapors of known food allergens have been reported as an occupational consequence of people working in the food industry, but can also take place in home situations, restaurants, or confined spaces such as airplanes. According to two reviews, respiratory symptoms are common, but in some cases there has been progression to anaphylaxis.[83][84] The most frequent reported cases of reactions by inhalation of allergenic foods were due to peanut, seafood, legumes, tree nut, and cow's milk.[83] Steam rising from cooking of lentils, green beans, chickpeas and fish has been well documented as triggering reactions, including anaphylactic reactions.[83][85] One review mentioned case study examples of allergic responses to inhalation of other foods, including examples in which oral consumption of the food is tolerated.[83]\\n\", 'Treatment[edit]', 'The mainstay of treatment for food allergy is total avoidance of the foods identified as allergens.  An allergen can enter the body by consuming a portion of food containing the allergen, and can also be ingested by touching any surfaces that may have come into contact with the allergen, then touching the eyes or nose. For people who are extremely sensitive, avoidance includes avoiding touching or inhaling problematic food. Total avoidance is complicated because the declaration of the presence of trace amounts of allergens in foods is not mandatory (see regulation of labelling).\\n', 'If the food is accidentally ingested and a systemic reaction (anaphylaxis) occurs, then epinephrine should be used. A second dose of epinephrine may be required for severe reactions.  The person should then be transported to the emergency room, where additional treatment can be given.  Other treatments include antihistamines and steroids.[86]\\n', 'Epinephrine[edit]', 'Epinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line treatment for severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis). If administered in a timely manner, epinephrine can reverse its effects. Epinephrine relieves airway swelling and obstruction, and improves blood circulation; blood vessels are tightened and heart rate is increased, improving circulation to body organs.  Epinephrine is available by prescription in an autoinjector.[87]\\n', 'Antihistamines[edit]', 'Antihistamines can alleviate some of the milder symptoms of an allergic reaction, but do not treat all symptoms of anaphylaxis.[88]  Antihistamines block the action of histamine, which causes blood vessels to dilate and become leaky to plasma proteins. Histamine also causes itchiness by acting on sensory nerve terminals.  The most common antihistamine given for food allergies is diphenhydramine.\\n', 'Steroids[edit]', 'Glucocorticoid steroids are used to calm down the immune system cells that are attacked by the chemicals released during an allergic reaction.  This treatment in the form of a nasal spray should not be used to treat anaphylaxis, for it only relieves symptoms in the area in which the steroid is in contact.  Another reason steroids should not be used is the delay in reducing inflammation.  Steroids can also be taken orally or through injection, by which every part of the body can be reached and treated, but a long time is usually needed for these to take effect.[89]\\n', 'Immunotherapy[edit]', 'Immunotherapies seek to condition the immune system to elicit or suppress a specific immune response. In the treatment of allergies, common immunotherapies seek to desensitize the immune system by gradually exposing the body to allergens in increasing amounts. These forms of immunotherapy have had varying and limited success and have generally been used to treat peanut and environmental allergies.[90]\\n', 'Omalizumab[edit]', 'Omalizumab, an injectable asthma treatment drug sold under the brand name Xolair, was approved in the United States in February 2024 to reduce severe reactions to accidental exposure to food allergens.[91] It is a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to immunoglobulin E (IgE) to reduce the severity of an immune response. Successful results were reported for wheat, eggs, milk and baked products containing wheat and milk.[92]\\n', 'Epidemiology[edit]', \"Food allergies affect up to 10% of the worldwide population, and they are currently more prevalent in children (~8%) than adults (~5) in western nations.[34] In several industrialized countries, food allergies affect up to 10% of children.[93] Children are most commonly allergic to cow's milk, chicken eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts.[21] While studies on adults with food allergy are not as abundant, surveys suggest that the most common food allergens for adults include fish, shellfish, peanuts, and tree nuts.[93]\\n\", 'Food allergies have become increasingly prevalent in industrialized/westernized nations over the last 2-3 decades.[94] An estimated 15 million people currently have food allergies in the United States.[95] In 1997, 0.4% children in the United States were reported to have peanut allergy, yet this number markedly rose to 1.4% in 2008.[96] In Australia, hospital admission rates for food-induced anaphylaxis increased by an average of 13.2% from 1994-2005.[93] One possible explanation for the rise in food allergy is the \"old friends\" hypothesis, which suggests that non disease causing organisms, such as helminths, could protect against allergy. Therefore, reduced exposure to these organisms, particularly in developed countries, could have contributed towards the increase.[citation needed]\\n', 'Children of East Asian or African descent who live in westernized countries were reported to be at significantly higher risk of food allergy compared to Caucasian children.[15] Several studies predict that Asia and Africa may experience a growth in food allergy prevalence as the lifestyles there become more westernized.[93]\\n', 'The prevalence of certain food allergies is suggested to depend partly on the geographical area and country. For instance, allergy to buckwheat flour, used for soba noodles, is more common in Japan than peanuts, tree nuts or foods made from soy beans.[97] Also, shellfish allergy is the most common cause of anaphylaxis in adults and adolescents particularly in East Asian countries like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Thailand.[93] Individuals in East Asia have further developed an allergy to rice, which forms a large part of their diet.[98] Another example is that, out of 9 European countries, egg allergy was found[by whom?] to be most prevalent in the UK and least prevalent in Greece.[citation needed]\\n', 'Special population: children[edit]', 'About 75% of children who have allergies to milk protein are able to tolerate baked-in milk products, i.e., muffins, cookies, cake, and hydrolyzed formulas.[99] About 50% of children with allergies to milk, egg, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, and wheat will outgrow their allergy by the age of 6. Those who are still allergic by the age of 12 or so have less than an 8% chance of outgrowing the allergy.[100]\\n', 'United States[edit]', 'In the United States, food allergy affects as many as 5% of infants less than three years of age[101] and 3% to 4% of adults.[102][103] The prevalence of food allergies is rising.[104][105][106] Food allergies cause roughly 30,000 emergency room visits and 150 deaths per year.[107]\\n', 'Regulation[edit]', \"Whether rates of food allergy are increasing or not, food allergy awareness has definitely increased, with impacts on the quality of life for children, their parents and their caregivers.[108][109][110][111] In the United States, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 causes people to be reminded of allergy problems every time they handle a food package, and restaurants have added allergen warnings to menus. The Culinary Institute of America, a premier school for chef training, has courses in allergen-free cooking and a separate teaching kitchen.[112] School systems have protocols about what foods can be brought into the school. Despite all these precautions, people with serious allergies are aware that accidental exposure can easily occur at other peoples' houses, at school or in restaurants.[113]\\n\", 'Regulation of labelling[edit]', 'In response to the risk that certain foods pose to those with food allergies, some countries have responded by instituting labeling laws that require food products to clearly inform consumers if their products contain priority allergens or byproducts of major allergens among the ingredients intentionally added to foods.\\n', 'The priority allergens vary by country.\\n', 'There are no labeling laws mandating declaration of the presence of trace amounts in the final product as a consequence of cross-contamination, except in Brazil.[120][121][122][123][124][125][126][127]\\n', 'Ingredients intentionally added[edit]', 'In the United States, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 requires companies to disclose on the label whether a packaged food product contains any of these eight major food allergens, added intentionally: cow\\'s milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy and wheat.[121] The eight-ingredient list originated in 1999 from the World Health Organisation Codex Alimentarius Commission.[126] To meet labeling requirements, if an ingredient is derived from one of the required-label allergens, then it must either have its \"food sourced name\" in parentheses, for example, \"Casein (milk),\" or as an alternative, there must be a statement separate but adjacent to the ingredients list: \"Contains milk\" (and any other of the allergens with mandatory labeling).[121][123] The European Union requires listing for those eight major allergens plus molluscs, celery, mustard, lupin, sesame and sulfites.[122]\\n', 'In 2018, the US FDA issued a request for information for the consideration of labeling for sesame to help protect people who have sesame allergies.[128] A decision was reached in November 2020 that food manufacturers voluntarily declare that when powdered sesame seeds are used as a previously unspecified spice or flavor, the label be changed to \"spice (sesame)\" or \"flavor (sesame).\"[129]\\n', 'Congress and the President passed a law in April 2021, the \"FASTER Act\", stipulating that labeling be mandatory, to be effect January 1, 2023, making it the ninth required food ingredient label.[130]\\n', 'The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 applies to packaged foods regulated by the FDA, which does not include poultry, most meats, certain egg products, and most alcoholic beverages.[127] However, some meat, poultry, and egg processed products may contain allergenic ingredients. These products are regulated by the Food Safety and Inspection Service, which requires that any ingredient be declared in the labeling only by its common or usual name. Neither the identification of the source of a specific ingredient in a parenthetical statement nor the use of statements to alert for the presence of specific ingredients, like \"Contains: milk\", are mandatory.[124][125]  The act also does not apply to food prepared in restaurants.[131][132] The EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation 1169/2011 – requires food businesses to provide allergy information on food sold unpackaged, for example, in catering outlets, deli counters, bakeries and sandwich bars.[133]\\n', 'In the United States, there is no federal mandate to address the presence of allergens in drug products, medicines, or cosmetics.[134]\\n', 'Trace amounts as a result of cross-contamination[edit]', 'The value of allergen labeling other than for intentional ingredients is controversial. This concerns labeling for ingredients present unintentionally as a consequence of cross-contact or cross-contamination at any point along the food chain (during raw material transportation, storage or handling, due to shared equipment for processing and packaging, etc.).[126][127] Experts in this field propose that if allergen labeling is to be useful to consumers, and healthcare professionals who advise and treat those consumers, ideally there should be agreement on which foods require labeling, threshold quantities below which labeling may be of no purpose, and validation of allergen detection methods to test and potentially recall foods that were deliberately or inadvertently contaminated.[135][136]\\n', 'Labeling regulations have been modified to provide for mandatory labeling of ingredients plus voluntary labeling, termed precautionary allergen labeling, also known as \"may contain\" statements, for possible, inadvertent, trace amount, cross-contamination during production.[126][137] Precautionary allergen labeling can be confusing to consumers, especially as there can be many variations on the wording of the warning.[137][138] Precautionary allergen labeling is optional in the United States.[139] As of 2014[update], precautionary allergen labeling is regulated only in Switzerland, Japan, Argentina, and South Africa. Argentina decided to prohibit precautionary allergen labeling since 2010 and instead puts the onus on the manufacturer to control the manufacturing process and label only those allergenic ingredients known to be in the products. South Africa does not permit the use of precautionary allergen labeling, except when manufacturers demonstrate the potential presence of allergen due to cross-contamination through a documented risk assessment and despite adherence to Good Manufacturing Practice.[126] In Australia and New Zealand there is a recommendation that precautionary allergen labeling be replaced by guidance from VITAL 2.0 (Vital Incidental Trace Allergen Labeling). A review identified \"the eliciting dose for an allergic reaction in 1% of the population\" as the threshold reference dose for certain foods (such as cow\\'s milk, egg, peanut and other proteins) to provide food manufacturers with guidance for developing precautionary labeling and give consumers a better idea of what might be accidentally in a food product beyond \"may contain.\"[140][141] VITAL 2.0 was developed by the Allergen Bureau, a food industry sponsored, non-government organization.[142] The European Union has initiated a process to create labeling regulations for unintentional contamination but is not expected to publish such before 2024.[143]\\n', 'In Brazil, since April 2016, the declaration of the possibility of cross-contamination is mandatory when the product does not intentionally add any allergenic food or its derivatives, but the Good Manufacturing Practices and allergen control measures adopted are not sufficient to prevent the presence of accidental trace amounts. These allergens include wheat, rye, barley, oats and their hybrids, crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, soybean, milk of all species of mammalians, almonds, hazelnuts, cashew nuts, Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, walnuts, pecan nuts, pistachios, pine nuts, and chestnuts.[120]\\n', 'Genetically modified food[edit]', 'Although there is a scientific consensus that available food derived from genetically modified crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food,[144][145][146] and a 2016 U.S. National Academy of Sciences report concluded that there is no relationship between consumption of genetically modified foods and the increase in prevalence of food allergies,[147] there are concerns that genetically modified foods, also described as foods sourced from genetically modified organisms, could be responsible for allergic reactions, and that the widespread acceptance of these types of foods may be responsible for what is a real or perceived increase in the percentage of people with allergies.[148][147][149]\\n', 'One concern is that genetic engineering could make an allergy-provoking food more allergic, meaning that smaller portions would suffice to set off a reaction.[149] Of the food currently[when?] in widespread use of genetically modified organisms, only soybeans are identified as a common allergen. However, for the soybean proteins known to trigger allergic reactions, there is more variation from strain to strain than between those and the genetically modified varieties.[147] Another concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic. Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.[148]\\n', 'Prior to a new genetically modified food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met.

In 1998 Starlink brand corn restricted to animals was detected in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then a FDA mandated recall.[150] There are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing genetically modified ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (similar to the requirements in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).[148]\\n', 'Restaurants[edit]', 'In the US, the FDA Food Code states that the person in charge in restaurants should have knowledge about major food allergens, cross-contacts, and symptoms of food allergy\\nreactions.

Self-diagnosed perceptions of food allergy are greater than the rates of true food allergy because people confuse non-allergic intolerance with allergy, and also attribute non-allergy symptoms to an allergic response.

Types of tropes: 1) characters have food allergies, providing a weakness that can be used to sabotage them. In the movie Parasite a housekeeper is displaced by taking advantage of her peach allergy.[156] In the animated film Peter Rabbit, the farm owner is attacked by being pelted with blackberries, causing an anaphylactic reaction requiring emergency treatment with epinephrine. After many public protests, Sony Pictures and the Peter Rabbit director apologized for making light of food allergies.[157] 2) Food allergy is used for comedic effect, such as in the movies Hitch and in television, Kelso's egg allergy in That '70s Show 3) Food allergies may be incorporated into characters who are also portrayed as annoying, weak and oversensitive, which can be taken as implying that their allergies are either not real or not potentially severe. In season 1, episode 16 of The Big Bang Theory Howard Wolowitz deliberately consumes a peanut-containing food bar (and has a serious reaction) just to delay Leonard from returning to his apartment where a surprise birthday party is being arranged. 4) Any of these portrayals may underplay the potential severity of food allergy, some showing that Benadryl treatment is sufficient.[156] Viewing of humorous portrayals of food allergies has been shown to have a negative effect on related health policy support due to low perceived seriousness.[155]\\n\", 'Research[edit]', 'Several theories have been suggested to explain why certain individuals develop allergic sensitization instead of oral tolerance to food allergens. One such theory is the dual allergen hypothesis, which states that ingesting food allergens early on promotes oral tolerance while skin exposure leads to sensitization.[95] Instead of oral ingestion, skin barrier disruption in conditions like eczema, for instance, was suggested to cause allergic sensitization in animal and human infants.[48] Inhalation was recently proposed to be an additional sensitization route in the dual allergen hypothesis.[42] Another theory is the barrier regulation hypothesis, describing the role of commensal bacteria in preventing the development of food allergy by maintaining integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier.[95] Environmental and lifestyle factors, such as early life nutrition and antibiotic treatment, may contribute to food allergy prevalence by affecting gut microbial composition, and thus, intestinal immune homeostasis in infants and young children.[158]\\n', 'A number of desensitization techniques are being studied.[159] Areas of research include specific oral tolerance induction (also known as oral immunotherapy), and sublingual immunotherapy. The benefits of allergen immunotherapy for food allergies is unclear, thus is not recommended as of 2015[update].[7]\\n', \"There is research on the effects of increasing intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids during pregnancy, lactation, via infant formula and in early childhood on the subsequent risk of developing food allergies during infancy and childhood. From two reviews, maternal intake of omega-3, long-chain fatty acids during pregnancy appeared to reduce the risks of medically diagnosed IgE-mediated allergy, eczema and food allergy per parental reporting in the first 12 months of life,[160][161] but the effects were not all sustained past 12 months.[161] The reviews characterized the literature's evidence as inconsistent and limited.[160][161] Results when breastfeeding mothers were consuming a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids were inconclusive.[162] For infants, supplementing their diet with oils high in polyunsaturated fatty acids did not affect the risks of food allergies, eczema or asthma either as infants or into childhood.[163]\\n\", 'There is research on probiotics, prebiotics and the combination of the two (synbiotics) as a means of treating or preventing infant and child allergies. From reviews, there appears to be a treatment benefit for eczema,[164][165][166] but not asthma, wheezing or rhinoconjunctivitis.[167] The evidence was not consistent for preventing food allergies and this approach cannot yet be recommended.[165][166][168][169]\\n', 'The Food Standards Agency, in the United Kingdom, are in charge of funding research into food allergies and intolerance.[152] Since their founding in 1994 they have funded over 45 studies.[152]\\xa0In 2005 Europe created EuroPrevall, a multi-country project dedicated to research involving allergies.[152]\\xa0\\n', 'See also[edit]', 'References[edit]', '\\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (July 2012). \"Food Allergy An Overview\" (PDF).

It is the world's largest passenger airliner and the only full-length double-deck jet airliner. Airbus studies started in 1988, and the project was announced in 1990 to challenge the dominance of the Boeing 747 in the long-haul market. The then-designated A3XX project was presented in 1994; Airbus launched the €9.5–billion ($10.7–billion) A380 programme on 19 December 2000. The first prototype was unveiled in Toulouse on 18 January 2005, with its first flight on 27 April 2005. It then obtained its type certificate from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on 12 December 2006. \\n\", \"Due to difficulties with the electrical wiring, the initial production was delayed by two years and the development costs almost doubled. It was first delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered service on 25 October. Production peaked at 30 per year in 2012 and 2014. Airbus ended production of the A380 in 2021. The A380's estimated $25\\xa0billion development cost was not recouped by the time Airbus ended production.\\n\", 'The full-length double-deck aircraft has a typical seating for 525 passengers, with a maximum certified capacity for 853 passengers. The quadjet is powered by Engine Alliance GP7200 or Rolls-Royce Trent 900 turbofans providing a range of 8,000\\xa0nmi (14,800\\xa0km; 9,200\\xa0mi). As of December\\xa02021[update], the global A380 fleet had completed more than 800,000 flights over 7.3\\xa0million block hours with no fatalities and no hull losses. As of December\\xa02022[update], there were 237 aircraft in service with 16 operators worldwide.\\n', 'Development[edit]', 'Background[edit]', 'In mid-1988, Airbus engineers, led by Jean Roeder, began work in secret on the development of an ultra-high-capacity airliner (UHCA), both to complete its own range of products and to break the dominance that Boeing had enjoyed in this market segment since the early 1970s with its 747.[3]:\\u200a7\\u200a McDonnell Douglas unsuccessfully offered its double-deck MD-12 concept for sale.[4][5] Lockheed was exploring the possibility for a Very Large Subsonic Transport.[6] Roeder was given approval for further evaluations of the UHCA after a formal presentation to the President and CEO in June 1990.\\n', 'The megaproject was announced at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow, with the stated goal of 15% lower operating costs than the 747-400.[3]:\\u200a16–17\\u200a Airbus organised four teams of designers, one from each of its partners (Aérospatiale, British Aerospace, Deutsche Aerospace AG, CASA) to propose new technologies for its future aircraft designs. The designs were presented in 1992 and the most competitive designs were used.[3]:\\u200a17–18\\u200a In January 1993, Boeing and several companies in the Airbus consortium started a joint feasibility study of a Very Large Commercial Transport (VLCT), aiming to form a partnership to share the limited market.[3]:\\u200a31\\u200a[7]\\n', \"In June 1994, Airbus announced its plan to develop its own very large airliner, designated as A3XX.[8][9] Airbus considered several designs, including an unusual side-by-side combination of two fuselages from its A340, the largest Airbus jet at the time.[3]:\\u200a19\\u200a The A3XX was pitted against the VLCT study and Boeing's own New Large Aircraft successor to the 747.[10][11] In July 1995, the joint study with Boeing was abandoned, as Boeing's interest had declined due to analysis that such a product was unlikely to cover the projected $15\\xa0billion development cost. Despite the fact that only two airlines had expressed public interest in purchasing such a plane, Airbus was already pursuing its own large-plane project. Analysts suggested that Boeing would instead pursue stretching its 747 design, and that air travel was already moving away from the hub-and-spoke system that consolidated traffic into large planes, and toward more non-stop routes that could be served by smaller planes.[12]\\n\", 'From 1997 to 2000, as the 1997 Asian financial crisis darkened the market outlook, Airbus refined its design, targeting a 15–20% reduction in operating costs over the existing Boeing 747-400. The A3XX design converged on a double-decker layout that provided more passenger volume than a traditional single-deck design.[13][14] Airbus did so in line with traditional hub-and-spoke theory, as opposed to the point-to-point theory with the Boeing 777,[15] after conducting an extensive market analysis with over 200 focus groups.[16][17] Although early marketing of the huge cross-section touted the possibility of duty-free shops, restaurant-like dining, gyms, casinos and beauty parlours on board, the realities of airline economics have kept such dreams grounded.\\n', 'On 19 December 2000, the supervisory board of newly restructured Airbus voted to launch a €9.5 billion ($10.7 billion) project to build the A3XX, re-designated as A380, with 50 firm orders from six launch customers.[18][19][20][21] The A380 designation was a break from previous Airbus families, which had progressed sequentially from A300 to A340. It was chosen because the number 8 resembles the double-deck cross section, and is a lucky number in many East Asian countries where the aircraft was being marketed.[3] The aircraft configuration was finalised in early 2001, and manufacturing of the first A380 wing-box component started on 23 January 2002. The development cost of the A380 had grown to €11–14[22]\\xa0billion when the first aircraft was completed.\\n', 'Total development cost[edit]', 'In 2000, the projected development cost was €9.5\\xa0billion.[23] In 2004, Airbus estimated that €1.5\\xa0billion ($2\\xa0billion) would need to be added, totalling the developmental costs to €10.3 billion ($12.7 billion).[24] In 2006, Airbus stopped publishing its reported cost after reaching costs of €10.2\\xa0billion and then it provisioned another €4.9\\xa0billion, after the difficulties in electric cabling and two years delay for an estimated total of €18\\xa0billion.[23]\\n', 'In 2014, the aircraft was estimated to have cost $25bn (£16bn, €18.9bn) to develop.[25] In 2015, Airbus said development costs were €15\\xa0billion (£11.4\\xa0billion, $16.64 billion), though analysts believe the figure is likely to be at least €5bn ($5.55 Bn) more for a €20 Bn ($22.19 Bn) total.[26] In 2016, The A380 development costs were estimated at $25\\xa0billion for 15 years,[27] $25–30\\xa0billion,[28] or €25\\xa0billion ($28\\xa0billion).[29]\\n', 'To start the programme in 2000, the governments of France, Germany and the UK loaned Airbus 3.5\\xa0billion euros and refundable advances reached 5.9\\xa0billion euros ($7.3\\xa0billion).\\nIn February 2018, after an Emirates order secured production of the unprofitable programme for ten years, Airbus revised its deal with the three loan-giving governments to save $1.4\\xa0billion (17%) and restructured terms to lower the production rate from eight per year in 2019 to six per year.[30]\\n', \"On 15 May 2018, in its EU appeal ruling, a WTO ruling concluded that the A380 received improper subsidies through $9\\xa0billion of launch aids, but Airbus acknowledges that the threat posed to Boeing by the A380 is so marginal with 330 orders since its 2000 launch that any U.S. sanctions should be minimal, as previous rulings showed Boeing's exposure could be as little as $377\\xa0million.[31]\\nIn 2018, unit cost was US$445.6\\xa0million.[32]\\n\", 'In February 2019, the German government disclosed that it was conducting talks with Airbus regarding €600\\xa0million in outstanding loans. Following the decision to wind down the A380 programme, Europe argues that the subsidies in effect no longer exist and that no sanctions are warranted.[33]\\n', 'Production[edit]', \"Major structural sections of the A380 are built in France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Due to the sections' large size, traditional transportation methods proved unfeasible,[34] so they are brought to the Jean-Luc Lagardère Plant assembly hall in Toulouse, France, by specialised road and water transportation, though some parts are moved by the A300-600ST Beluga transport aircraft.[35][36] A380 components are provided by suppliers from around the world; the four largest contributors, by value, are Rolls-Royce, Safran, United Technologies and General Electric.[16]\\n\", 'For the surface movement of large A380 structural components, a complex route known as the Itinéraire à Grand Gabarit was developed. This involved the construction of a fleet of roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ships and barges, the construction of port facilities and the development of new and modified roads to accommodate oversized road convoys.[37] The front and rear fuselage sections are shipped on one of three RORO ships from Hamburg in northern Germany to Saint-Nazaire in France. The ship travels via Mostyn, Wales, where the wings are loaded.[38] The wings are manufactured at Broughton in North Wales, then transported by barge to Mostyn docks for ship transport.[39]\\n', 'In Saint-Nazaire, the ship exchanges the fuselage sections from Hamburg for larger, assembled sections, some of which include the nose. This ship unloads in Bordeaux. It then goes to pick up the belly and tail sections from Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA in Cádiz, Spain, and delivers them to Bordeaux. From there, the A380 parts are transported by barge to Langon, and by oversize road convoys to the assembly hall in Toulouse.[40] To avoid damage from direct handling, parts are secured in custom jigs carried on self-powered wheeled vehicles.[34]\\n', 'After assembly, the aircraft are flown to the Airbus Hamburg-Finkenwerder plant to be furnished and painted. Airbus sized the production facilities and supply chain for a production rate of four A380s per month.[39]\\n', 'Testing[edit]', 'In 2005, five A380s were built for testing and demonstration purposes.[41] The first A380, registered F-WWOW, was unveiled in Toulouse 18 January 2005.[42] It first flew on 27 April 2005.[43] This plane, equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, flew from Toulouse–Blagnac Airport with a crew of six headed by chief test pilot Jacques Rosay.[44] Rosay said flying the A380 had been \"like handling a bicycle\".[45]\\n', 'On 1 December 2005, the A380 achieved its maximum design speed of Mach\\xa00.96, (its design cruise speed is Mach\\xa00.85) in a shallow dive.[41] In 2006, the A380 flew its first high-altitude test at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport. It conducted its second high-altitude test at the same airport in 2009.[46] On 10 January 2006, it flew to José María Córdova International Airport in Colombia, accomplishing the transatlantic testing, and then it went to El Dorado International Airport to test the engine operation in high-altitude airports. It arrived in North America on 6 February 2006, landing in Iqaluit, Nunavut, in Canada for cold-weather testing.[47]\\n', 'On 14 February 2006, during the destructive wing strength certification test on MSN5000, the test wing of the A380 failed at 145% of the limit load, short of the required 150% level. Airbus announced modifications adding 30\\xa0kg (66\\xa0lb) to the wing to provide the required strength.[48] On 26 March 2006, the A380 underwent evacuation certification in Hamburg. With 8 of the 16 exits randomly blocked, 853 mixed passengers and 20 crew exited the darkened aircraft in 78 seconds, less than the 90 seconds required for certification.[49][50] Three days later, the A380 received European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval to carry up to 853 passengers.[51]\\n', \"The first A380 using GP7200 engines—serial number MSN009 and flew on 25 August 2006.[52][53] On 4 September 2006, the first full passenger-carrying flight test took place.[54] The aircraft flew from Toulouse with 474 Airbus employees on board, in a test of passenger facilities and comfort.[54] In November 2006, a further series of route-proving flights demonstrated the aircraft's performance for 150 flight hours under typical airline operating conditions.[55] As of 2014[update], the A380 test aircraft continue to perform test procedures.[56]\\n\", \"Airbus obtained type certificates for the A380-841 and A380-842 model from the EASA and FAA on 12 December 2006 in a joint ceremony at the company's French headquarters,[57][58] receiving the ICAO code A388.[59] The A380-861 model was added to the type certificate on 14 December 2007.[58]\\n\", 'Production and delivery delays[edit]', 'Initial production of the A380 was troubled by delays attributed to the 530\\xa0km (330\\xa0mi) of wiring in each aircraft. Airbus cited as underlying causes the complexity of the cabin wiring (98,000 wires and 40,000 connectors), its concurrent design and production, the high degree of customisation for each airline, and failures of configuration management and change control.[60][61] The German and Spanish Airbus facilities continued to use CATIA version\\xa04, while British and French sites migrated to version\\xa05.[62] This caused overall configuration management problems, at least in part because wire harnesses manufactured using aluminium rather than copper conductors necessitated special design rules including non-standard dimensions and bend radii; these were not easily transferred between versions of the software.[63] File conversion tools were initially developed by Airbus to help solve this problem; however, the digital mock-up was still unable to read the full technical design data.[64] Furthermore, organisational culture was also cited as a cause of the production delays. The communication and reporting culture at the time frowned upon delivery of bad news, meaning Airbus was unable to take early actions to mitigate technical and production issues.[64]\\n', \"Airbus announced the first delay in June 2005 and notified airlines that deliveries would be delayed by six months.[62] This reduced the total number of planned deliveries by the end of 2009 from about 120 to 90–100. On 13 June 2006, Airbus announced a second delay, with the delivery schedule slipping an additional six to seven months.[65] Although the first delivery was still planned before the end of 2006, deliveries in 2007 would drop to only 9 aircraft, and deliveries by the end of 2009 would be cut to 70–80 aircraft. The announcement caused a 26% drop in the share price of Airbus' parent, EADS,[66] and led to the departure of EADS CEO Paul Dupont, Airbus CEO Gustav Humbert, and A380 programme manager Charles Champion.[62][67] On 3 October 2006, upon completion of a review of the A380 programme, Airbus CEO Christian Streiff announced a third delay,[62] pushing the first delivery to October 2007, to be followed by 13 deliveries in 2008, 25 in 2009, and the full production rate of 45 aircraft per year in 2010.[68] The delay also increased the earnings shortfall projected by Airbus through 2010 to €4.8\\xa0billion.[62][69]\\n\", 'As Airbus prioritised the work on the A380-800 over the A380F,[70] freighter orders were cancelled by FedEx[71][72] and United Parcel Service,[73] or converted to A380-800 by Emirates and ILFC.[74] Airbus suspended work on the freighter version, but said it remained on offer,[75] albeit without a service entry date.[76] For the passenger version Airbus negotiated a revised delivery schedule and compensation with the 13 customers, all of which retained their orders with some placing subsequent orders, including Emirates,[77] Singapore Airlines,[78] Qantas,[79] Air France,[80] Qatar Airways,[81] and Korean Air.[82]\\n', 'Beginning in 2007, the A380 was considered as a potential replacement for the existing Boeing VC-25 serving as Air Force One presidential transport,[83][84] but in January 2009 EADS declared that they were not going to bid for the contract, as assembling only three planes in the US would not make financial sense.[85]\\n', 'On 13 May 2008, Airbus announced reduced deliveries for the years 2008 (12) and 2009 (21).[86] After further manufacturing setbacks, Airbus announced its plan to deliver 14 A380s in 2009, down from the previously revised target of 18.[87] A total of 10 A380s were delivered in 2009.[88] In 2010, Airbus delivered 18 of the expected 20 A380s, due to Rolls-Royce engine availability problems.[89] Airbus planned to deliver \"between 20 and 25\" A380s in 2011 before ramping up to three a month in 2012.[89] In fact, Airbus delivered 26 units, thus outdoing its predicted output for the first time. As of July\\xa02012[update], production was 3 aircraft per month. Among the production problems are challenging interiors, interiors being installed sequentially rather than concurrently as in smaller planes, and union/government objections to streamlining.[90]\\n', 'Entry into service[edit]', \"Nicknamed Superjumbo,[91] the first A380, MSN003, was delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered service on 25 October 2007 with flight number SQ380 between Singapore and Sydney.[92] Passengers bought seats in a charity online auction paying between $560 and $100,380.[93] Two months later, Singapore Airlines CEO Chew Choong Seng stated the A380 was performing better than either the airline or Airbus had anticipated, burning 20% less fuel per seat-mile than the airline's 747-400 fleet.[94] Emirates' Tim Clark claimed that the A380 has better fuel economy at Mach 0.86 than at 0.83,[95] and that its technical dispatch reliability is at 97%, the same as Singapore Airlines. Airbus is committed to reach the industry standard of 98.5%.[96]\\n\", 'Emirates was the second airline to receive the A380 and commenced service between Dubai and New York in August 2008.[97][98] Qantas followed, with flights between Melbourne and Los Angeles in October 2008.[99] By the end of 2008, 890,000 passengers had flown on 2,200 flights.[100]\\n', 'In February 2008, the A380 became the first airliner to fly using synthetic liquid fuel. The fuel is processed from gas to liquid form (GTL fuel). The flight was 3 hours long, taking off from Filton, UK, and landing in Toulouse, France, and was a significant step in evaluating the suitability of sustainable aviation fuels.[101]\\n', 'Improvements and upgrades[edit]', 'In 2010, Airbus announced a new A380 build standard, incorporating a strengthened airframe structure and a 1.5° increase in wing twist. Airbus also offered, as an option, an improved maximum take-off weight, thus providing a better payload/range performance. Maximum take-off weight is increased by 4\\xa0t (8,800\\xa0lb), to 573\\xa0t (1,263,000\\xa0lb) and the range is extended by 100 nautical miles (190\\xa0km; 120\\xa0mi); this is achieved by reducing flight loads, partly from optimising the fly-by-wire control laws.[102] British Airways and Emirates were the first two customers to have received this new option in 2013.[103] Emirates asked for an update with new engines for the A380 to be competitive with the Boeing 777X around 2020, and Airbus was studying 11-abreast seating.[104]\\n', \"In 2012, Airbus announced another increase in the A380's maximum take-off weight to 575\\xa0t (1,268,000\\xa0lb), a 6\\xa0t increase from the initial A380 variant and 2\\xa0t higher than the increased-weight proposal of 2010. This increased the range by some 150 nautical miles (280\\xa0km; 170\\xa0mi), taking its capability to around 8,350 nautical miles (15,460\\xa0km; 9,610\\xa0mi) at current payloads. The higher-weight version was offered for introduction to service early in 2013.[105]\\n\", 'Post-delivery problems[edit]', 'During repairs following the Qantas Flight 32 engine failure incident, cracks were discovered in wing fittings. As a result, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued an Airworthiness Directive in January 2012 which affected 20 A380 aircraft that had accumulated over 1,300 flights.[106] A380s with under 1,800 flight hours were to be inspected within 6 weeks or 84 flights; aircraft with over 1,800 flight hours were to be examined within four days or 14 flights.[107][108] Fittings found to be cracked were replaced.[109] On 8 February 2012, the checks were extended to cover all 68 A380 aircraft in operation. The problem is considered to be minor and is not expected to affect operations.[110] EADS acknowledged that the cost of repairs would be over $130\\xa0million, to be borne by Airbus. The company said the problem was traced to stress and material used for the fittings.[111] Additionally, major airlines are seeking compensation from Airbus for revenue lost as a result of the cracks and subsequent grounding of fleets.[112] Airbus has switched to a different type of aluminium alloy so aircraft delivered from 2014 onwards should not have this problem.[113]\\n', 'Around 2014, Airbus changed about 10% of all A380 doors, as some leaked during flight. One occurrence resulted in dropped oxygen masks and an emergency landing. The switch was estimated to cost over €100\\xa0million. Airbus stated that safety was sufficient, as the air pressure pushed the door into the frame.[114][115][116]\\n', 'Further continuation of programme[edit]', 'At the July 2016 Farnborough Airshow, Airbus announced that in a \"prudent, proactive step\", starting in 2018, it expected to deliver 12 A380 aircraft per year, down from 27 deliveries in 2015. The firm also warned production might slip back into red ink (be unprofitable) on each aircraft produced at that time, though it anticipated production would remain in the black (profitable) for 2016 and 2017. \"The company will continue to improve the efficiency of its industrial system to achieve breakeven at 20 aircraft in 2017 and targets additional cost reduction initiatives to lower breakeven further.\"[117][118] Airbus expected that healthy demand for its other aircraft would allow it to avoid job losses from the cuts.[119][120]\\n', 'As Airbus expected to build 15 airliners in 2017 and 12 in 2018, Airbus Commercial Aircraft president Fabrice Brégier said that, without orders in 2017, production would be reduced to below one per month while remaining profitable per unit and allowing the programme to continue for 20 to 30 years.[121]\\nIn its 2017 half-year report, Airbus adjusted 2019 deliveries to eight aircraft.[122]\\nIn November 2017, its chief executive Tom Enders was confident Airbus would still produce A380s in 2027 with more sales to come, and further develop it to keep it competitive beyond 2030.[123] Airbus was profitable at a rate of 15 per year and is trying to drive breakeven down further but will take losses at eight per year.[124]\\n', 'An order from Emirates for 36 A380s would have ensured production beyond 2020, but the airline wanted guarantees that production would be maintained for 10 years, until 2028: reducing output to six a year would help to bridge that period and would support second-hand values while other buyers are approached, but the programme would still be unprofitable.[125] If it had failed to win the Emirates order, Airbus claimed that it was ready to phase out its production gradually as it fulfilled remaining orders until the early 2020s.[126] In January 2018, Emirates confirmed the order for 36 A380s,[127][128] but the deal was thrown back into question in October 2018 over a disagreement regarding engine fuel burn.[129]\\n', 'To extend the programme, Airbus offered China a production role in early 2018.[130] While state-owned Chinese airlines could order A380s, it would not help their low yield, as it lowers frequency; they do not need more volume as widebody aircraft are already used on domestic routes and using the A380 on its intended long-haul missions would free only a few airport slots.[131]\\n', 'After achieving efficiencies to sustain production at a lower level, in 2017, Airbus delivered 15 A380s and was \"very close\" to production breakeven, expecting to make additional savings as production was being further reduced: it planned to deliver 12 in 2018, eight in 2019 and six per year from 2020 with \"digestible\" losses.\\nAs of February\\xa02018[update], Enders was confident the A380 would gain additional orders from existing or new operators, and saw opportunities in Asia and particularly in China where it is \"under-represented\".[132]\\n', 'In 2019, Lufthansa had retired 6 of its 14 A380s due to their unprofitability. Later that year, Qatar Airways announced a switch from the A380 to the Boeing 777X starting from 2024.[133]\\n', 'End of production[edit]', 'In February 2019, Airbus announced it would end A380 production by 2021, after its main customer, Emirates, agreed to drop an order for 39 of the aircraft, replacing it with 40 A330-900s and 30 A350-900s.[135] At the time of the announcement, Airbus had 17 more A380s on its order book to complete before closing the production line\\xa0– 14 for Emirates and three for All Nippon Airways\\xa0– taking the total number of expected deliveries of the aircraft type to 251.[136][137] Airbus would have needed more than $90\\xa0million profit from the sale of each aircraft to cover the estimated $25\\xa0billion development cost of the programme. However, the $445\\xa0million price tag of each aircraft was not sufficient to even cover the production cost, so with Airbus losing money on each A380, and with orders evaporating, it made economic sense to cease production.[138][139] Enders stated on 14 February 2019, \"If you have a product that nobody wants anymore, or you can sell only below production cost, you have to stop it.\"[140]\\n', 'One reason that the A380 did not achieve commercial viability for Airbus has been attributed to its extremely large capacity being optimised for a hub-and-spoke system, which was projected by Airbus to be thriving when the programme was conceived. However, airlines underwent a fundamental transition to a point-to-point system, which gets customers to their destination in one flight instead of two or three. The massive scale of the A380 design was able to achieve a very low cost for passenger seat-distance, but efficiency within the hub-and-spoke paradigm was not able to overcome the efficiency of fewer flights required in the point-to-point system. Specifically, US based carriers had been using a multihub strategy, which only justified the need for a handful of VLAs (very large aircraft with more than 400 seats) such as the A380, and having too few VLAs meant that they could not achieve economy of scale to spread out the enormous fixed cost of the VLA support infrastructure.[141] Consequently, orders for VLAs slowed in the mid 2010s, as widebody twin jets now offer similar range and greater fuel efficiency, giving airlines more flexibility at a lower upfront cost.[142][143][144][145]\\n', 'On 25 September 2020, Airbus completed assembly of the final A380 fuselage. Nine aircraft remained to be delivered (eight for Emirates, one for All Nippon Airways) and production operations continued to finish those aircraft. On 17 March 2021, the final Airbus A380 (manufacturing serial number 272) made its maiden flight from Toulouse to Hamburg for cabin outfitting,[146] before being delivered to Emirates on 16 December 2021.[147][148]\\n', 'Design[edit]', 'Overview[edit]', 'The A380 was initially offered in two models: the A380-800 and the A380F.\\n', \"The A380-800's original configuration carried 555 passengers in a three-class configuration[149] or 853 passengers (538 on the main deck and 315 on the upper deck) in a single-class economy configuration. Then in May 2007, Airbus began marketing a configuration with 30 fewer passengers (525 total in three classes)—traded for 200\\xa0nmi; 230\\xa0mi (370\\xa0km) more range—to better reflect trends in premium-class accommodation.[150] The design range for the A380−800 model is 8,500\\xa0nmi (15,700\\xa0km);[151] capable of flying from Hong Kong to New York or from Sydney to Istanbul non-stop. The A380 is designed for 19,000 cycles.[152]\\n\", 'The second model, the A380F freighter, would have carried 150\\xa0t (330,000\\xa0lb) of cargo over a range of 5,600\\xa0nmi (10,400\\xa0km; 6,400\\xa0mi).[153] Freighter development was put on hold as Airbus prioritised the passenger version, and all orders for freighters were cancelled.\\n', 'Other proposed variants included an A380-900 stretch\\xa0– seating about 656 passengers (or up to 960 passengers in an all-economy configuration)\\xa0– and an extended-range version with the same passenger capacity as the A380-800.[3]\\n', 'Engines[edit]', \"The A380 is offered with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 (A380-841/-842) or the Engine Alliance GP7000 (A380-861) turbofan engines.[154]\\nThe Trent 900 is a combination of the 3\\xa0m (118\\xa0in) fan and scaled IP compressor of the 777-200X/300X Trent 8104 technology demonstrator derived from the Boeing 777's Trent 800, and the Airbus A340-500/600's Trent 500 core.\\nThe GP7200 HP core technology is derived from GE's GE90 and its LP sections are based on the PW4000 expertise.[155]\\nAt its launch in 2000, engine makers assured Airbus it was getting the best level of technology and they would be state-of-the-art for the next decade, but three years later Boeing launched the 787 Dreamliner with game-changing technology and 10% lower fuel burn than the previous generation, to the dismay of John Leahy.[156]\\n\", \"Due to its modern engines and aerodynamic improvements, Lufthansa's A380s produce half the noise of the Boeing 747-200 while carrying 160 more passengers.[157] In 2012, the A380 received an award from the Noise Abatement Society.[158]\\n\", \"London Heathrow is a key destination for the A380.[3]\\nThe aircraft is below the QC/2 departure and QC/0.5 arrival noise limits under the Quota Count system set by the airport.[159] Field measurements suggest the approach quota allocation for the A380 may be excessively generous compared to the older Boeing 747, but still quieter.[160][161] Rolls-Royce is supporting the CAA in understanding the relatively high A380/Trent 900 monitored noise levels.[162] Heathrow's landing charges having a noise component, the A380 is cheaper to land there than a Boeing 777-200 and -300 and it saves $4,300 to $5,200 per landing, or $15.3M to $18.8M of present value over 15 years. Tokyo Narita has a similar noise charge.[163]\\n\", \"The A380 has thrust reversers on the inboard engines only. The outboard engines lack them, reducing the amount of debris stirred up during landing.[164][165] The combination of wheel braking and large spoilers and flaps reduces the aircraft's reliance on thrust reversal.[164] The reversers are electrically actuated to save weight, and for greater reliability than pneumatic or hydraulic equivalents.[166] Having reversers on only two engines also saves a great deal of maintenance expense for operators as well as avoiding unnecessary weight to the outboard engines.[164]\\n\", 'Wings[edit]', \"The A380's wings are built for a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) over 600\\xa0tonnes to accommodate larger variants—the A380F freighter would require added internal strengthening.[3][167] The optimal wingspan for such an MTOW is about 90\\xa0m (300\\xa0ft) but airport restrictions of 80\\xa0m (260\\xa0ft) force the A380 to compensate with a longer chord for an aspect ratio of 7.8.[104] This suboptimal aspect ratio reduces fuel efficiency[104] by about 10% and increases operating costs several percent,[168] considering fuel costs constitute about 50% of the cost of long-haul aeroplane operation.[169] The common wing design approach sacrifices fuel efficiency on the A380-800 passenger model in particular because its lower MTOW allows for a higher aspect ratio with a shorter chord or thinner wing.\\n\", \"Still, Airbus estimated that the A380's size and advanced technology would provide lower operating costs per passenger than the 747-400. The wings incorporate wingtip fences that extend above and below the wing surface, similar to those on the A310 and A320. These increase fuel efficiency and range by reducing induced drag.[170] The wingtip fences also reduce wake turbulence, which endangers following aircraft.[171] The wings of the A380 were designed in Filton and manufactured in Broughton in the United Kingdom. The wings were then transported to the harbour of Mostyn, where they were transported by barge to Toulouse, France, for integration and final assembly with the rest of the aircraft and its components.[172]\\n\", 'Singapore Airlines describe the A380\\'s landing speed of 130–135\\xa0kn (240–250\\xa0km/h) as \"impressively slow\".[173]\\n', 'Materials[edit]', \"While most of the fuselage is made of aluminium alloys, composite materials comprise more than 20% of the A380's airframe.[174] Carbon-fibre reinforced plastic, glass-fibre reinforced plastic and quartz-fibre reinforced plastic are used extensively in wings, fuselage sections (such as the undercarriage and rear end of fuselage), tail surfaces, and doors.[175][176][177] The A380 is the first commercial airliner to have a central wing box made of carbon–fibre reinforced plastic. It is also the first to have a smoothly contoured wing cross–section. The wings of other commercial airliners are partitioned span-wise into sections. This flowing continuous cross section reduces aerodynamic drag. Thermoplastics are used in the leading edges of the slats.[178]\\n\", \"The hybrid fibre metal laminate material GLARE (glass laminate aluminium reinforced epoxy) is used in the upper fuselage and on the stabilisers' leading edges.[179] This aluminium-glass-fibre laminate is lighter and has better corrosion and impact resistance than conventional aluminium alloys used in aviation.[180] Unlike earlier composite materials, GLARE can be repaired using conventional aluminium repair techniques.[citation needed]\\n\", \"Newer weldable aluminium alloys are used in the A380's airframe. This enabled the widespread use of laser beam welding manufacturing techniques, eliminating rows of rivets and resulting in a lighter, stronger structure.[181] High-strength aluminium (type 7449)[182] reinforced with carbon fibre was used in the wing brackets of the first 120 A380s to reduce weight, but cracks were discovered and newer sets of the more critical brackets are made of standard aluminium 7010, increasing weight by 90\\xa0kg (198\\xa0lb).[183] Repair costs for earlier aircraft were expected to be around €500\\xa0million (US$629\\xa0million).[184]\\n\", 'It takes 3,600\\xa0L (950\\xa0US\\xa0gal) of paint to cover the 3,100\\xa0m2 (33,000\\xa0sq\\xa0ft) exterior of an A380.[185] The paint is five layers thick and weighs about 650\\xa0kg (1,433\\xa0lb) when dry.[186]\\n', 'Avionics[edit]', 'The A380 employs an integrated modular avionics (IMA) architecture, first used in advanced military aircraft, such as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II,[187] and Dassault Rafale.[188] The main IMA systems on the A380 were developed by the Thales Group.[189] Designed and developed by Airbus, Thales and Diehl Aerospace, the IMA suite was first used on the A380. The suite is a technological innovation, with networked computing modules to support different applications.[189] The data networks use Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet, an implementation of ARINC 664. These are switched, full-duplex, star-topology and based on 100baseTX fast-Ethernet.[190] This reduces the amount of wiring required and minimises latency.[191]\\n', 'Airbus used similar cockpit layout, procedures and handling characteristics to other Airbus aircraft, reducing crew training costs. The A380 has an improved glass cockpit, using fly-by-wire flight controls linked to side-sticks.[192][193] The cockpit has eight 15 by 20\\xa0cm (5.9 by 7.9\\xa0in) liquid crystal displays, all physically identical and interchangeable; comprising two primary flight displays, two navigation displays, one engine parameter display, one system display and two multi-function displays. The MFDs were introduced on the A380 to provide an easy-to-use interface to the flight management system—replacing three multifunction control and display units.[194] They include QWERTY keyboards and trackballs, interfacing with a graphical \"point-and-click\" display system.[195][196]\\n', 'The Network Systems Server (NSS) is the heart of A380s paperless cockpit; it eliminates bulky manuals and traditional charts.[197][198] The NSS has enough inbuilt robustness to eliminate onboard backup paper documents. The A380s network and server system stores data and offers electronic documentation, providing a required equipment list, navigation charts, performance calculations, and an aircraft logbook. This is accessed through the MFDs and controlled via the keyboard interface.[191]\\n', 'Systems[edit]', 'Power-by-wire flight control actuators have been used for the first time in civil aviation to back up primary hydraulic actuators. Also, during certain manoeuvres they augment the primary actuators.[199] They have self-contained hydraulic and electrical power supplies. Electro-hydrostatic actuators (EHA) are used in the aileron and elevator, electric and hydraulic motors to drive the slats as well as electrical backup hydrostatic actuators (EBHA) for the rudder and some spoilers.[200]\\n', \"The A380's 350\\xa0bar (35\\xa0MPa or 5,000\\xa0psi) hydraulic system is a significant difference from the typical 210\\xa0bar (21\\xa0MPa or 3,000\\xa0psi) hydraulics used on most commercial aircraft since the 1940s.[201][202] First used in military aircraft, high-pressure hydraulics reduce the weight and size of pipelines, actuators and related components. The 350\\xa0bar pressure is generated by eight de-clutchable hydraulic pumps.[202][203] The hydraulic lines are typically made from titanium; the system features both fuel- and air-cooled heat exchangers. Self-contained electrically powered hydraulic power packs serve as backups for the primary systems, instead of a secondary hydraulic system, saving weight and reducing maintenance.[204]\\n\", 'The A380 uses four 150\\xa0kVA variable-frequency electrical generators,[205] eliminating constant-speed drives and improving reliability.[206] The A380 uses aluminium power cables instead of copper for weight reduction. The electrical power system is fully computerised and many contactors and breakers have been replaced by solid-state devices for better performance and increased reliability.[200]\\n', 'The auxiliary power comprises the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), the electronic control box (ECB), and mounting hardware. The APU in use on the A380 is the 1,300\\xa0kW PW 980A APU. The APU primarily provides air to power the Analysis Ground Station (AGS) on the ground and to start the engines. The AGS is a semi-automatic analysis system of flight data that helps to optimise management of maintenance and reduce costs. The APU also powers two 120\\xa0kVA electric generators that provide auxiliary electric power to the aircraft. There is also a ram air turbine (RAT) with a 70\\xa0kVA generator.[207]\\n', 'Passenger provisions[edit]', \"The A380-800's cabin has 550 square metres (5,920\\xa0sq\\xa0ft) of usable floor space,[208] 40% more than the next largest airliner, the Boeing 747-8.[209]\\n\", 'The cabin has features to reduce traveller fatigue such as a quieter interior and higher pressurisation than previous generations of aircraft; the A380 is pressurised to the equivalent altitude of 1,520\\xa0m (5,000\\xa0ft) up to 12,000\\xa0m (39,000\\xa0ft).[210][3]:\\u200a129\\u200a It has 50% less cabin noise, 50% more cabin area and volume, larger windows, bigger overhead bins, and 60\\xa0cm (2.0\\xa0ft) more headroom than the 747-400.[211][212] Seating options range from 3-room 12\\xa0m2 (130\\xa0sq\\xa0ft) \"residence\" in first class to 11-across in economy.[213] A380 economy seats are up to 48\\xa0cm (19\\xa0in) wide in a 10-abreast configuration,[214] compared with the 10-abreast configuration on the 747-400 that typically has seats 44.5\\xa0cm (17.5\\xa0in) wide.[215] On other aircraft, economy seats range from 41.5 to 52.3\\xa0cm (16.3 to 20.6\\xa0in) in width.[216]\\n', 'The A380\\'s upper and lower decks are connected by two stairways, one fore and one aft, both wide enough to accommodate two passengers side by side; this cabin arrangement allows multiple seat configurations. The maximum certified carrying capacity is 853 passengers in an all-economy-class layout,[49] Airbus lists the \"typical\" three-class layout as accommodating 525 passengers, with 10 first, 76 business, and 439 economy class seats.[150] Airline configurations range from Korean Air\\'s 407 passengers to Emirates\\' two-class 615 seats[217] and average around 480–490 seats.[218][219] Air Austral\\'s proposed 840 passenger layout has not come to fruition. The A380\\'s interior illumination system uses bulbless LEDs in the cabin, cockpit, and cargo decks. The LEDs in the cabin can be altered to create an ambience simulating daylight, night, or intermediate levels.[220] On the outside of the aircraft, HID lighting is used for brighter illumination.\\n', \"Airbus's publicity has stressed the comfort and space of the A380 cabin,[221] and advertised onboard relaxation areas such as bars, beauty salons, duty-free shops, and restaurants.[222][223] Proposed amenities resembled those installed on earlier airliners, particularly 1970s wide-body jets,[224] which largely gave way to regular seats for greater passenger capacity.[224] Airbus has acknowledged that some cabin proposals were unlikely to be installed,[223] and that it was ultimately the airlines' decision how to configure the interior.[224] Industry analysts suggested that implementing customisation has slowed the production speeds, and raised costs.[225] Due to delivery delays, Singapore Airlines and Air France debuted their seat designs on different aircraft prior to the A380.[226][227]\\n\", 'Initial operators typically configured their A380s for three-class service, while adding extra features for passengers in premium cabins. Launch customer Singapore Airlines introduced partly enclosed first-class suites on its A380s in 2007, each featuring a leather seat with a separate bed; center suites could be joined to create a double bed.[228][229][230] A year later, Qantas debuted a new first-class seat-bed and a sofa lounge at the front of the upper deck on its A380s,[231][232] and in 2009, Air France unveiled an upper deck electronic art gallery.[233] In late 2008, Emirates introduced \"shower spas\" in first class on its A380s allowing each first class passenger five minutes of hot water,[234][235] drawing on 2.5 tonnes of water, although only 60% of it was used.[236]\\n', 'Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways also have a bar lounge and seating area on the upper deck, while Etihad has enclosed areas for two people each.[237] In addition to lounge areas, some A380 operators have installed amenities consistent with other aircraft in their respective fleets, including self-serve snack bars,[238] premium economy sections,[227] and redesigned business-class seating.[226]\\n', \"The Hamburg Aircraft Interiors Expo in April 2015 saw the presentation of an 11-seat row economy cabin for the A380.  Airbus is reacting to a changing economy; the recession which began in 2008 saw a drop in market percentage of first class and business seats to six percent and an increase in budget economy travellers. Among other causes is the reluctance of employers to pay for executives to travel in First or Business Class. Airbus' chief of cabin marketing, Ingo Wuggestzer, told Aviation Week and Space Technology that the standard three-class cabin no longer reflected market conditions. The 11-seat row on the A380 is accompanied by similar options on other widebodies: nine across on the Airbus A330 and ten across on the A350.[239]\\n\", 'Integration with infrastructure and regulations[edit]', 'Ground operations[edit]', 'In the 1990s, aircraft manufacturers were planning to introduce larger planes than the Boeing 747. In a common effort of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) with manufacturers, airports and its member agencies, the \"80-metre box\" was created, the airport gates allowing planes up to 80\\xa0m (260\\xa0ft) wingspan and length to be accommodated.[240] Airbus designed the A380 according to these guidelines,[241][242] and to operate safely on Group V runways and taxiways with a 60 metres (200\\xa0ft) loadbearing width.[243] The US FAA initially opposed this,[244][245] then in July 2007, the FAA and EASA agreed to let the A380 operate on 45\\xa0m (148\\xa0ft) runways without restrictions.[246] The A380-800 is approximately 30% larger in overall size than the 747-400.[247][248] Runway lighting and signage may need changes to provide clearance to the wings and avoid blast damage from the engines. Runways, runway shoulders and taxiway shoulders may be required to be stabilised to reduce the likelihood of foreign object damage caused to (or by) the outboard engines, which are more than 25\\xa0m (82\\xa0ft) from the centre line of the aircraft,[241][243][249] compared to 21\\xa0m (69\\xa0ft) for the 747-400,[250] and 747-8.[251]\\n', \"Airbus measured pavement loads using a 540-tonne (595\\xa0short tons) ballasted test rig, designed to replicate the landing gear of the A380. The rig was towed over a section of pavement at Airbus's facilities that had been instrumented with embedded load sensors.[252] It was determined that the pavement of most runways will not need to be reinforced despite the higher weight,[249] as it is distributed on more wheels than in other passenger aircraft with a total of 22 wheels (that is, its ground pressure is lower).[253] The A380 undercarriage consists of four main landing gear legs and one noseleg (a layout similar to that of the 747), with the two inboard landing gear legs each supporting six wheels.[253][254]\\n\", \"The A380 requires service vehicles with lifts capable of reaching the upper deck,[255] as well as tractors capable of handling the A380's maximum ramp weight.[256] When using two jetway bridges the boarding time is 45 min, and when using an extra jetway to the upper deck it is reduced to 34 min.[257] The A380 has an airport turnaround time of 90–110 minutes.[236] In 2008, the A380 test aircraft were used to trial the modifications made to several airports to accommodate the type.[258]\\n\", 'Takeoff and landing separation[edit]', 'As of 2023, the A380 is the only aircraft in wake turbulence category Super (J).[259]\\n', \"In 2005, the ICAO recommended that provisional separation criteria for the A380 on takeoff[260] and landing be substantially greater than for the 747 because preliminary flight test data suggested a stronger wake turbulence.[261][262] These criteria were in effect while the ICAO's wake vortex steering group, with representatives from the JAA, Eurocontrol, the FAA, and Airbus, refined its 3-year study of the issue with additional flight testing. In September 2006, the working group presented its first conclusions to the ICAO.[263][264]\\n\", 'In November 2006, the ICAO issued new interim recommendations. Replacing a blanket 10 nautical miles (19\\xa0km; 12\\xa0mi) separation for aircraft trailing an A380 during approach, the new distances were 6\\xa0nmi (11\\xa0km; 6.9\\xa0mi), 8\\xa0nmi (15\\xa0km; 9.2\\xa0mi) and 10\\xa0nmi (19\\xa0km; 12\\xa0mi) respectively for non-A380 \"Heavy\", \"Medium\", and \"Light\" ICAO aircraft categories.

Another A380 following an A380 should maintain a separation of 4\\xa0nmi (7.4\\xa0km). On departure behind an A380, non-A380 \"Heavy\" aircraft are required to wait two minutes, and \"Medium\"/\"Light\" aircraft three minutes for time based operations. The ICAO also recommends that pilots append the term \"Super\" to the aircraft\\'s callsign when initiating communication with air traffic control, to distinguish the A380 from \"Heavy\" aircraft.[265]\\n', 'In August 2008, the ICAO issued revised approach separations of 4\\xa0nmi (7.4\\xa0km; 4.6\\xa0mi) for Super (another A380), 6\\xa0nmi (11\\xa0km; 6.9\\xa0mi) for Heavy, 7\\xa0nmi (13\\xa0km; 8.1\\xa0mi) for medium/small, and 8\\xa0nmi (15\\xa0km; 9.2\\xa0mi) for light.[266] In November 2008, an incident on a parallel runway during crosswinds made the Australian authorities change procedures for those conditions.[267]\\n', 'Maintenance[edit]', 'As the A380 fleet grows older, airworthiness authority rules require certain scheduled inspections from approved aircraft tool shops. The increasing fleet size (at the time projected to reach 286 aircraft in 2020) cause expected maintenance and modification to cost $6.8\\xa0billion for 2015–2020, of which $2.1\\xa0billion are for engines.

Deliveries to customers were planned for sometime in 2020 or 2021.[296] On 19 July 2015, Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier stated that the company will build a new version of the A380 featuring new improved wings and new engines.[297] Speculation about the development of a so-called A380neo (\"neo\" for \"new engine option\") had been going on for a few months after earlier press releases in 2014,[298] and in 2015, the company was considering whether to end production of the type prior to 2018[294] or develop a new A380 variant. Later it was revealed that Airbus was looking at both the possibility of a longer A380 in line of the previously planned A380-900[299] and a new engine version, i.e. A380neo. Brégier also revealed that the new variant would be ready to enter service by 2020.[300] The engine would most likely be one of a variety of all-new options from Rolls-Royce, ranging from derivatives of the A350\\'s XWB-84/97 to the future Advance project due at around 2020.[301][302]\\n', 'On 3 June 2016, Emirates President Tim Clark stated that talks between Emirates and Airbus on the A380neo have \"lapsed\".[303] On 12 June 2017, Fabrice Brégier confirmed that Airbus would not launch an A380neo, stating \"...there is no business case to do that, this is absolutely clear.\" However, Brégier stated it would not stop Airbus from looking at what could be done to improve the performance of the aircraft. One such proposal is a 32\\xa0ft (9.8\\xa0m) wingspan extension to reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency by 4%,[304] though further increase is likely to be seen on the aircraft with new Sharklets like on the A380plus.[304]\\nTim Clark stated the proposed re-engining would have offered a 12-14% fuel-burn reduction with an enhanced Trent XWB.[305]\\n', 'In June 2023, despite A380 production having ceased, Clark renewed his plea for a re-engined A380neo, suggesting that a next-generation Rolls-Royce UltraFan could give a 25% reduction in fuel burn and emissions.[306]\\n', 'A380plus[edit]', \"At the June 2017 Paris Air Show, Airbus proposed an enhanced variant, called the A380plus, with 13% lower costs per seat, featuring up to 80 more seats through better use of cabin space, split scimitar winglets and wing refinements allowing a 4% fuel economy improvement, and longer aircraft maintenance intervals with less downtime.[307] The A380plus' maximum takeoff weight would have been increased by 3\\xa0t (6,600\\xa0lb) to 578\\xa0t (1,274,000\\xa0lb), allowing it to carry more passengers over the same 8,200\\xa0nmi (15,200\\xa0km; 9,400\\xa0mi) range or increase the range by 300\\xa0nmi (560\\xa0km; 350\\xa0mi).\\n\", 'Winglet mockups, 4.7\\xa0m (15\\xa0ft 5\\xa0in) high, were displayed on the MSN04 test aircraft at Le Bourget. Wing twist would have been modified and camber changed by increasing its height by 33 millimetres (1+1⁄4\\xa0in) between Rib 10 and Rib 30, along with upper-belly fairing improvements. The in-flight entertainment, the flight management system and the fuel pumps would be from the A350 to reduce weight and improve reliability and fuel economy. Light checks for the A380plus would be required after 1,000\\xa0h instead of 750\\xa0h and heavy check downtime would be reduced to keep the aircraft flying for six days more per year.[308]\\n', 'Market[edit]', 'Size[edit]', 'In its 2000 Global Market Forecast, Airbus estimated a demand for 1,235 passenger Very Large Aircraft (VLA), with more than 400 seats: 360 up to 2009 and 875 by 2019.[309]\\nIn late 2003, Boeing forecast 320 \"Boeing 747 and larger\" passenger aircraft over 20 years, close to the 298 orders actually placed for the A380 and 747-8 passenger airliners as of March 2020.[310]\\n', 'In 2007, Airbus estimated a demand for 1,283 VLAs in the following 20 years if airport congestion remains constant, up to 1,771 VLAs if congestion increases, with most deliveries (56%) in Asia-Pacific, and 415 very large, 120-tonne plus freighters.[311] For the same period, Boeing was estimating the demand for 590 large (747 or A380) passenger airliners and 630 freighters.[312]\\nEstimates for the total over a twenty-year period have varied from 400 to over 1,700.[16][313]\\n', 'Frequency and capacity[edit]', 'In 2013, Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines needed to balance frequency and capacity.[314] China Southern struggled for two years to use its A380s from Beijing, and finally received Boeing 787s in its base in Guangzhou, but where it cannot command a premium, unlike Beijing or Shanghai.[315][316] In 2013, Air France withdrew A380 services to Singapore and Montreal and switched to smaller aircraft.[317]\\n', 'In 2014, British Airways replaced three 777 flights between London and Los Angeles with two A380 per day.[318] Emirates\\' Tim Clark saw a large potential for East Asian A380-users, and criticised Airbus\\' marketing efforts.[319] As many business travellers prefer more choices offered by greater flight frequency achieved by flying any given route multiple times on smaller aircraft, rather than fewer flights on larger planes, United Airlines observed the A380 \"just doesn\\'t really work for us\" with a much higher trip cost than the Boeing 787.[320]\\n', 'At the A380 launch, most Europe-Asia and transpacific routes used Boeing 747-400s at fairly low frequencies but, since then, routes proliferated with open skies, and most airlines downsized, offering higher frequencies and more routes.\\nThe huge capacity offered by each flight eroded the yield: North America was viewed as 17% of the market but the A380 never materialised as a 747 replacement, with only 15 747s remaining in passenger service in November 2017 for transpacific routes, where time zones restrict potential frequency. Consolidation changed the networks, and US majors constrained capacity and emphasised daily frequencies for business traffic with midsize widebodies like the 787, to extract higher yields; the focus being on profits, with market share ceded to Asian carriers.[309]\\n', \"The 747 was largely replaced on transatlantic flights by the 767, and on the transpacific flights by the 777[citation needed]; newer, smaller aircraft with similar seat-mile costs have lower trip costs and allow more direct routes.\\nCabin 'densification', to lower unit costs, could aggravate this overcapacity.[309]\\n\", 'Production[edit]', 'In 2005, 270 sales were necessary to attain break-even and with 751 expected deliveries its internal rate of return outlook was at 19%, but due to disruptions in the ramp-up leading to overcosts and delayed deliveries, it increased to 420 in 2006.[321] In 2010, EADS CFO Hans Peter Ring said that break-even could be achieved by 2015 when 200 deliveries were projected.[322] In 2012, Airbus clarified that the aircraft production costs would be less than its sales price.[90]\\n', 'On 11 December 2014, Airbus chief financial officer Harald Wilhelm hinted the possibility of ending the programme in 2018, disappointing Emirates president Tim Clark.[323] Airbus shares fell down consequently.[324] Airbus responded to the protests by playing down the possibility the A380 would be abandoned, instead emphasising that enhancing the aeroplane was a likelier scenario.[325] On 22 December 2014, as the jet was about to break even, Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier ruled out cancelling it.[326]\\n', 'Ten years after its first flight, Brégier said it was \"almost certainly introduced ten years too early\".[327] While no longer losing money on each plane sold, Airbus admits that the company will never recoup the $25\\xa0billion investment it made in the project.[328]\\n', 'Airbus consistently forecast 1,400 VLA demand over 20-year, still in 2017, and aimed to secure a 50% share, up to 700 units, but delivered 215 aircraft in 10 years, achieving three produced per month but not the four per month target after the ramp-up to achieve more than 350 and is now declining to 0.5 a month.\\nAs Boeing see the VLA market as too small to retain in its 2017 forecast, its VP marketing Randy Tinseth does not believe Airbus will deliver the rest of the backlog.[309]\\n', 'Richard Aboulafia predicted a 2020 final delivery, with unpleasant losses due to \"hubris, shoddy market analysis, nationalism and simple wishful thinking\".\\nIn 2017, the A380 fleet exceeded the number of remaining passenger B747s, which had declined from 740 aircraft when the A380 was launched in 2000 to 550 units when the A380 was introduced in 2007, and around 200 ten years later. However, the market-share battle has shifted to large single-aisles and 300-seat twin-aisles.[309]\\n', 'Cost[edit]', 'As of 2016[update], the list price of an A380 was US$432.6\\xa0million.[329] Negotiated discounts made the actual prices much lower, and industry experts questioned whether the A380 project would ever pay for itself.[90] The first aircraft was sold and leased back by Singapore Airlines in 2007 to Dr. Peters for $197\\xa0million.[330] In 2016, IAG\\'s Willie Walsh said he could add a few, but also that he found the price of new aircraft \"outrageous\" and would source them from the second-hand market.[309]\\n', \"AirInsight estimates its hourly cost at $26,000, or around $50 per seat hour (when configured for only 520 seats), which compares to $44 per seat hour for a Boeing 777-300ER, and $90 per seat hour for a Boeing 747-400 as of November\\xa02015[update].[331] The A380 was designed with large wing and tail surfaces to accommodate a planned stretch; this resulted in a high empty weight per seat.[309] The stretch never occurred to take advantage of this, and the A380's cost-per-seat is expected to be matched by the A350-1000 and 777-9.[309]\\n\", 'Economic aspects[edit]', 'With a theoretical maximum seating capacity of 853 seats, which is not used by any airline, the Airbus A380 consumes 2.4 liters of kerosene per 100 passenger kilometers. This increases with a reduced seating capacity from 555 to 3.5 l/100 pkm and is 5.2 liters of kerosene per 100 passenger kilometers in the smallest possible variant with only 362 seats.[332]\\n', 'Secondary[edit]', 'As of 2015, several airlines expressed their interest in selling their aircraft, partially coinciding with expiring lease contracts for the aircraft. Several in-service A380s were offered for lease to other airlines. The suggestion prompted concerns on the potential for new sales for Airbus, although these were dismissed by Airbus COO John Leahy who stated that \"Used A380s do not compete with new A380s\", noting that the second-hand market is more interesting for parties otherwise looking to buy smaller aircraft such as the Boeing 777.[333]\\n', 'After Malaysia Airlines was unable to sell or lease its six A380s, it decided to refurbish the aircraft with seating for 700 and transfer them to a subsidiary carrier for religious pilgrimage flights.[334] As it started receiving its six A350s to replace its A380s in December 2017, the new subsidiary will serve the Hajj and Umrah market with them, starting in the third quarter of 2018 and could be expanded above six beyond 2020 to 2022. The cabin will have 36 business seats and 600 economy seats, with a 712-seat reconfiguration possible within five days. The fleet could be chartered half the year for the tourism industry like cruise shipping and will be able to operate for the next 40 years if oil prices stay low.[335]\\nAs they should be parked by June 2018 before reconfiguration, MAS confirmed the plans and will also use them for peak periods to high traffic markets like London.[336]\\n', 'In August 2017, it was announced that Hi Fly would lease two used aircraft. The Portuguese ACMI/charter airline will use the aircraft for markets where high capacity is needed and airports where slots are scarce. The first aircraft was scheduled to begin commercial operations during the first quarter of 2018[337][338] Hi Fly was to receive its A380s from mid 2018 in a 471-seat configuration: 399 on the main deck, 60 business-class and 12 first-class seats on the upper deck, the Singapore Airlines layout.[339] Hi Fly first used one of their A380s on 1 August 2018 for a one-off flight to enable Thomas Cook Airlines to repatriate passengers from Rhodes to Copenhagen following IT problems in the Greek airport.[340] The same aircraft was then wet-leased to Norwegian to operate its evening London-New York service for several weeks in August 2018, to alleviate availability issues on its Boeing 787s affected by Trent 1000 engine problems;[341] Air Austral also signed a deal to wet-lease an A380 from Hi Fly while one of its 787s is grounded for three months of Trent 1000 inspections.[342]\\nAs of December 2019, Hi Fly has leased one used A380.\\n', 'Amedeo, mainly an A380 lessor and the largest with 22, mostly leased to Emirates, wants to find a use for them after their lease expires from 2022, and study if there is a demand to wet lease them.[343]\\nSwiss aircraft broker Sparfell & Partners plans to convert for head-of-state or VVIP transport some of Dr. Peters\\' four ex-SIA A380s for under $300\\xa0million apiece, less than a new Boeing 777 or Airbus A330.[344]\\nAs of November 2018, Air France was planning to return five of its A380s to lessors by the end of 2019 and refurbish its other five with new interiors by 2020 for $51\\xa0million per aircraft.[345] By July 2019, Air France revised this plan and intended to phase out all ten of its A380s by 2022 as part of an \"accelerated\" retirement plan, replacing them with no more than nine twin-engined wide-body aircraft. The A330-900, A350-900 and 787-9 were being evaluated as potential replacements.[346]\\n', 'Following the cancellation of the programme in February 2019, the residual value of existing aircraft is in doubt. While Amedeo argued that cancellation should benefit the value, this will depend on whether any new airlines are prepared to adopt second-hand A380s, and how many existing users continue to operate the aircraft. Even the teardown value is questionable, in that the engines, usually the most valuable part of a scrap aircraft, are not used by any other models.[347]\\n', 'Teardown and second-hand market[edit]', 'With four A380s leased to Singapore Airlines having been returned between October 2017 and March 2018, Dr. Peters feared a weak aftermarket and is considering scrapping them, although they are on sale for a business jet conversion, but on the other hand Airbus sees a potential for African airlines and Chinese airlines, Hajj charters and its large Gulf operators.[348] An A380 parted out may be worth $30\\xa0million to $50\\xa0million if it is at half-life.[349] Teardown specialists have declined offers for several aircraft at part-out prices due to high risk as a secondary market is uncertain with $30 to $40\\xa0million for the refurbishment, but should be between $20 and $30\\xa0million to be viable.[350]\\n', 'When the aircraft were proposed to British Airways, Hi Fly and Iran Air, BA did not want to replace its Boeing 747s until 2021, while Iran Air faced political uncertainty and Hi Fly did not have a convincing business case. Consequently, Dr. Peters recommended to its investors on 28 June 2018 to sell the aircraft parts with VAS Aero Services within two years for US$45\\xa0million, quickly for components like the landing gear or the APU.\\nRolls-Royce Trent 900 leasing beyond March 2019 should generate US$480,000 monthly for each aircraft before selling the turbofans by 2020. With a total revenue of US$80\\xa0million per aircraft, the overall return expected is 145–155% while 72% and 81% of their debt had already been repaid.[351]\\n', 'The fifth plane coming back from SIA, owned by Doric, has been leased by Hi Fly Malta with a lease period of \"nearly 6 years\".[352] Hi Fly Malta became the first operator of second-hand A380 (MSN006).[353] Norwegian Long Haul briefly leased Hi Fly Malta A380 in August 2018, which operated the aircraft following engine problems with their Dreamliner fleet.[354] Norwegian leased the A380 again in late 2018 to help deal with the passenger backlog as a result of the Gatwick Airport drone incident.\\n', 'Two others returned from Singapore Airlines in the coming weeks (June 2018) but they could stay with an existing Asian A380 flag carrier.[355][356]\\n', 'The teardown value includes $32–$33\\xa0million from the engines in 2020 and $4\\xa0million from leasing them until then, while the value of a 2008 A380 would be $78.4\\xa0million in 2020 and its monthly lease in 2018 would be $929,000.\\nThe two aircraft have returned 3.8–4.2% per year since 2008 but the 145–155% return is lower than the 220% originally forecast.\\nOf the nearly 500 made, 50 747-400s were sold in the secondary market, including only 25 to new customers.[357]\\nThese are among the first A380s delivered, lacking the improvements and weight savings of later ones.[358]\\n', 'The first two A380s delivered to Singapore Airlines (MSN003 and MSN005) flew to Tarbes, France, to be scrapped. Their engines and some components had been dismantled and removed while the livery was painted over in white.[359]\\n', 'As of September 2019, Emirates initiated its A380 retirement plan\\xa0– which will see the type remain in service until at least 2035\\xa0– by retiring two aircraft that were due for a major overhaul, and using them as parts donors for the rest of the fleet. Emirates does not see any demand in the second-hand market, but is indifferent in that the retired aircraft have already been fully written down and thus have no residual value. As further aircraft are retired, Emirates-owned airframes will continue to be used for parts, while leased airframes will be returned to the lessors.[360] One such return to lessor Doric was purchased by Emirates for £25.3\\xa0million in late 2022, as spare parts.[361]\\n', 'Orders and deliveries[edit]', 'Fourteen customers have ordered and taken delivery of the A380 as of April 2019. Total orders for the A380 stand at 251 as of November\\xa02019[update].[362] The biggest customer is Emirates, which has committed to order a total of 123 A380s as of 14 February 2019.[362][363] One VIP order was made in 2007[364] but later cancelled by Airbus.[365] The A380F version attracted 27 orders, before they were either cancelled (20) or converted to A380-800 (7) following the production delay and the subsequent suspension of the freighter programme.\\n', 'Delivery takes place in Hamburg for customers from Europe and the Middle East and in Toulouse for customers from the rest of the world.[366] EADS explained that deliveries in 2013 were to be slowed temporarily to accommodate replacement of the wing rib brackets where cracks were detected earlier in the existing fleet.[367]\\n', 'In 2013, in expectation of raising the number of orders placed, Airbus announced \"attractable discounts\" to airlines who placed large orders for the A380.[failed verification] Soon after, at the November 2013 Dubai Air Show, Emirates ordered 150 777X and Etihad Airways ordered 50 aircraft, totalling $20\\xa0billion.[368]\\n', \"In late July 2014, Airbus announced that it had terminated five A380 firm orders from the Japanese low-cost carrier, Skymark Airlines, citing concerns over the airline's financial performance.[369] In 2016, the largest Japanese carrier, All Nippon Airways (ANA), took over three of the orders and the remaining two that were already produced and put into long-term storage were taken up later by the main customer, Emirates. [370] Qantas planned to order eight more aircraft but froze its order while the airline restructured its operations.[371] Qantas eventually cancelled its order in February 2019 amid doubts over the A380's future.[372]\\n\", 'Amedeo, an aircraft lessor that ordered 20 A380s, had not found a client for the airliner and eventually cancelled their order in 2019.[373][374]\\nVirgin Atlantic ordered six A380s in 2001 but never took delivery and later cancelled them in 2018.[375]\\n', 'In June 2017, Emirates had 48 orders outstanding, but due to lack of space in Dubai Airport, it deferred 12 deliveries by one year and would not take any in 2019–20 before replacing its early airliners from 2021. There were open production slots in 2019, and Airbus reduced its production rate in 2017–2018 at 12 per year. The real backlog is much smaller than the official 107 with 47 uncertain orders: 20 commitments for the A380-specialized lessor Amedeo which commits to production only once aircraft are placed, eight for Qantas which wants to keep its fleet at 12, six for Virgin Atlantic which does not want them any more and three ex Transaero for finance vehicle Air Accord.[376]\\n', 'At its 100th delivery ceremony, Emirates CEO Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum was hoping to order new A380s at the November 2017 Dubai Air Show.[377] Emirates does not need the small front staircase and eleven-abreast economy of the A380plus concept, but wants Airbus to commit to continue production for at least 10 years.[124]\\nOn 18 January 2018, Airbus secured a preliminary agreement from Emirates for up to 36 A380s, to be delivered from 2020, valued at $16\\xa0billion at list prices.[378] The contract was signed in February 2018, comprising a firm order for 20 A380s and options on 16 more.[379]\\n', \"In early 2019, Airbus confirmed it was in discussions with Emirates over its A380 contract.[380] If the A380's only stable client were to drop the type, Airbus could cease production of the superjumbo.[381] Emirates is at odds with Rolls-Royce over shortfalls in fuel savings from the Trent 900s, and could switch its order for 36 A380s to the smaller A350.[382] The A350 could also replace its provisional order for 40 Boeing 787-10s, placed in 2017, as engine margins on the 787 are insufficient for the hot Dubai weather.[383][384]\\n\", \"On 14 February 2019, Emirates decided to cancel its order for 39 planes, opting to replace them with A350s and A330neos.[135] Airbus stated that this cancellation would bring the A380's production to an end when the last unfilled orders are delivered in 2021.[135][385]\\n\", 'On 21 March 2019, All Nippon Airways received its first of three A380s painted with the Sea Turtle livery.[386] Called the ANA Blue, this A380 will be used for 3 flights a week, going from Tokyo to Honolulu and back.[387]\\n', 'In October 2021, Emirates announced it would receive its final three A380s to be delivered with the last aircraft in December 2021, thus ending production of the A380.\\n', 'Timeline[edit]', 'Cumulative orders and deliveries\\n', 'Data as of December 2021.[1][362][388]', '\\u2003Orders', '\\u2003Deliveries', '\\n', 'Operators[edit]', 'There were 234 aircraft (of 251 delivered) in service with 10 operators as of March\\xa02024[update], with Emirates being the largest operator with 120 A380s in its fleet.[389]\\n', 'Current operators[edit]', 'Former operators[edit]', 'The following airlines did operate A380 aircraft and since phased them out:\\n', 'Aircraft on display[edit]', 'Incidents[edit]', 'The global A380 fleet has zero fatalities and no hull loss accidents as of December\\xa02023[update],[418] but was involved in two notable incidents.[418][419][420]\\n', 'Specifications (A380-800, Trent engines)[edit]', 'Data from Airbus[241]', 'General characteristics\\n', 'Performance\\n', 'Aircraft Type Designations[edit]', 'See also[edit]', '\\nRelated development\\n', 'Aircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\\n', '\\nRelated lists\\n', 'Notes[edit]', '\\n^ Final assembly in France\\n\\n^ Max. design speed: Mach\\xa00.96 (1,020\\xa0km/h; 551\\xa0kn; 634\\xa0mph) in dive at cruise altitude[432]\\n\\n', 'References[edit]', '\\n^ a b c d \"The A380, Emirates and flying public\\xa0: A winning combination\".

      "['From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia', 'Contents', 'George Eliot', '\\n', 'Mary Ann Evans (22 November 1819 – 22 December 1880; alternatively Mary Anne or Marian[1][2]), known by her pen name George Eliot, was an English novelist, poet, journalist, translator, and one of the leading writers of the Victorian era.[3] She wrote seven novels: Adam Bede (1859), The Mill on the Floss (1860), Silas Marner (1861), Romola (1862–1863), Felix Holt, the Radical (1866), Middlemarch (1871–1872) and Daniel Deronda (1876). As with Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy, she emerged from provincial England; most of her works are set there. Her works are known for their realism, psychological insight, sense of place and detailed depiction of the countryside. Middlemarch was described by the novelist Virginia Woolf as \"one of the few English novels written for grown-up people\"[4]  and by Martin Amis[5] and Julian Barnes[6] as the greatest novel in the English language.\\n', \"Scandalously and unconventionally for the era, she lived with the married George Henry Lewes as his conjugal partner, from 1854–1878, and called him her husband. He remained married to his wife and supported their children, even after she left him to live with another man and have children with him. In May 1880, eighteen months after Lewes's death, George Eliot married her long-time friend, John Cross, a man much younger than she, and she changed her name to Mary Ann Cross.\\n\", 'Life[edit]', 'Early life and education[edit]', 'Mary Ann Evans was born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, at South Farm on the Arbury Hall estate.[7] She was the third child of Welshman Robert Evans (1773–1849), manager of the Arbury Hall estate, and Christiana Evans (née Pearson, 1788–1836), daughter of a local mill-owner. Her full siblings were: Christiana, known as Chrissey (1814–1859), Isaac (1816–1890), and twin brothers who died a few days after birth in March 1821. She also had a half-brother, Robert Evans (1802–1864), and half-sister, Frances \"Fanny\" Evans Houghton (1805–1882), from her father\\'s previous marriage to Harriet Poynton (1780–1809). In early 1820, the family moved to a house named Griff House, between Nuneaton and Bedworth.[8]\\n', \"The young Evans was a voracious reader and obviously intelligent. Because she was not considered physically beautiful, Evans was not thought to have much chance of marriage, and this, coupled with her intelligence, led her father to invest in an education not often afforded to women.[9] From ages five to nine, she boarded with her sister Chrissey at Miss Latham's school in Attleborough, from ages nine to thirteen at Mrs. Wallington's school in Nuneaton, and from ages thirteen to sixteen at Miss Franklin's school in Coventry. At Mrs. Wallington's school, she was taught by the evangelical Maria Lewis—to whom her earliest surviving letters are addressed. In the religious atmosphere of the Misses Franklin's school, Evans was exposed to a quiet, disciplined belief opposed to evangelicalism.[10]\\n\", 'After age sixteen, Evans had little formal education.[11] Thanks to her father\\'s important role on the estate, she was allowed access to the library of Arbury Hall, which greatly aided her self-education and breadth of learning. Her classical education left its mark; Christopher Stray has observed that \"George Eliot\\'s novels draw heavily on Greek literature (only one of her books can be printed correctly without the use of a Greek typeface), and her themes are often influenced by Greek tragedy\".[12] Her frequent visits to the estate also allowed her to contrast the wealth in which the local landowner lived with the lives of the often much poorer people on the estate, and different lives lived in parallel would reappear in many of her works. The other important early influence in her life was religion. She was brought up within a low church Anglican family, but at that time the Midlands was an area with a growing number of religious dissenters.\\n', 'Move to Coventry[edit]', 'In 1836, her mother died and Evans (then 16) returned home to act as housekeeper, though she continued to correspond with her tutor Maria Lewis. When she was 21, her brother Isaac married and took over the family home, so Evans and her father moved to Foleshill near Coventry. The closeness to Coventry society brought new influences, most notably those of Charles and Cara Bray. Charles Bray had become rich as a ribbon manufacturer and had used his wealth in the building of schools and in other philanthropic causes. Evans, who had been struggling with religious doubts for some time, became intimate friends with the radical, free-thinking Brays, who had a casual view of marital obligations[13] and the Brays\\' \"Rosehill\" home was a haven for people who held and debated radical views. The people whom the young woman met at the Brays\\' house included Robert Owen, Herbert Spencer, Harriet Martineau, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Through this society Evans was introduced to more liberal and agnostic theologies and to writers such as David Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach, who cast doubt on the literal truth of Biblical texts. In fact, her first major literary work was an English translation of Strauss\\'s Das Leben Jesu kritisch bearbeitet  as The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined (1846), which she completed after it had been left incomplete by Elizabeth \"Rufa\" Brabant, another member of the \"Rosehill Circle\".\\n', 'The Strauss book had caused a sensation in Germany by arguing that the miracles in the New Testament were mythical additions with little basis in fact.[14][15][16] Evans\\'s translation had a similar effect in England, with the Earl of Shaftesbury calling her translation \"the most pestilential book ever vomited out of the jaws of hell.\"[17][18][19][20] Later she translated Feuerbach\\'s The Essence of Christianity (1854). The ideas in these books would have an effect on her own fiction.\\n', 'As a product of their friendship, Bray published some of Evans\\'s own earliest writing, such as reviews, in his newspaper the Coventry Herald and Observer.[21] As Evans began to question her own religious faith, her father threatened to throw her out of the house, but his threat was not carried out. Instead, she respectfully attended church and continued to keep house for him until his death in 1849, when she was 30. Five days after her father\\'s funeral, she travelled to Switzerland with the Brays. She decided to stay on in Geneva alone, living first on the lake at Plongeon (near the present-day United Nations buildings) and then on the second floor of a house owned by her friends François and Juliet d\\'Albert Durade on the rue de Chanoines (now the rue de la Pelisserie). She commented happily that \"one feels in a downy nest high up in a good old tree\". Her stay is commemorated by a plaque on the building. While residing there, she read avidly and took long walks in the beautiful Swiss countryside, which was a great inspiration to her. François Durade painted her portrait there as well.[22]\\n', 'Move to London and editorship of the Westminster Review[edit]', 'On her return to England the following year (1850), she moved to London with the intent of becoming a writer, and she began referring to herself as Marian Evans.[23] She stayed at the house of John Chapman, the radical publisher whom she had met earlier at Rosehill and who had published her Strauss translation. She then joined Chapman\\'s ménage-à-trois along with his wife and mistress.[13] Chapman had recently purchased the campaigning, left-wing journal The Westminster Review. Evans became its assistant editor in 1851 after joining just a year earlier. Evans\\'s writings for the paper were comments on her views of society and the Victorian way of thinking.[24] She was sympathetic to the lower classes and criticised organised religion throughout her articles and reviews and commented on contemporary ideas of the time.[25] Much of this was drawn from her own experiences and knowledge and she used this to critique other ideas and organisations. This led to her writing being viewed as authentic and wise but not too obviously opinionated. Evans also focused on the business side of the Review with attempts to change its layout and design.[26] Although Chapman was officially the editor, it was Evans who did most of the work of producing the journal, contributing many essays and reviews beginning with the January 1852 issue and continuing until the end of her employment at the Review in the first half of 1854.[27] Eliot sympathized with the 1848 Revolutions throughout continental Europe, and even hoped that the Italians would chase the \"odious Austrians\" out of Lombardy and that \"decayed monarchs\" would be pensioned off, although she believed a gradual reformist approach to social problems was best for England.[28][29]\\n', 'In 1850–51, Evans attended classes in mathematics at the Ladies College in Bedford Square, later known as Bedford College, London.[30]\\n', 'Relationship with George Henry Lewes[edit]', \"The philosopher and critic George Henry Lewes (1817–1878) met Evans in 1851, and by 1854 they had decided to live together. Lewes was already married to Agnes Jervis, although in an open marriage. In addition to the three children they had together, Agnes also had four children by Thornton Leigh Hunt.[31]  In July 1854, Lewes and Evans travelled to Weimar and Berlin together for the purpose of research. Before going to Germany, Evans continued her theological work with a translation of Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity, and while abroad she wrote essays and worked on her translation of Baruch Spinoza's Ethics, which she completed in 1856, but which was not published in her lifetime because the prospective publisher refused to pay the requested £75.[32] In 1981, Eliot's translation of Spinoza's Ethics was finally published by Thomas Deegan, and was determined to be in the public domain in 2018 and published by the George Eliot Archive.[33] It has been re-published in 2020 by Princeton University Press.[34]\\n\", 'The trip to Germany also served as a honeymoon for Evans and Lewes, who subsequently considered themselves married. Evans began to refer to Lewes as her husband and to sign her name as Mary Ann Evans Lewes, legally changing her name to Mary Ann Evans Lewes after his death.[35] The refusal to conceal the relationship was contrary to the social conventions of the time, and attracted considerable disapproval.[citation needed]\\n', 'Career in fiction[edit]', 'While continuing to contribute pieces to the Westminster Review, Evans resolved to become a novelist, and set out a pertinent manifesto in one of her last essays for the Review, \"Silly Novels by Lady Novelists\"[36] (1856). The essay criticised the trivial and ridiculous plots of contemporary fiction written by women. In other essays, she praised the realism of novels that were being written in Europe at the time,  an emphasis on realistic storytelling confirmed in her own subsequent fiction. She also adopted a nom-de-plume, George Eliot; as she explained to her biographer J. W. Cross, George was Lewes\\'s forename, and Eliot was \"a good mouth-filling, easily pronounced word\".[37] Although female authors were published under their own names during her lifetime, she wanted to escape the stereotype of women\\'s writing being limited to lighthearted romances or other lighter fare not to be taken very seriously.[38] She also wanted to have her fiction judged separately from her already extensive and widely known work as a translator, editor, and critic. Another factor in her use of a pen name may have been a desire to shield her private life from public scrutiny, thus avoiding the scandal that would have arisen because of her relationship with Lewes, who was married.[39]\\n', 'In 1857, when she was 37 years of age, \"The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Amos Barton\", the first of the three stories included in Scenes of Clerical Life, and the first work of \"George Eliot\", was published in Blackwood\\'s Magazine.[40] The Scenes (published as a 2-volume book in 1858),[40] was well received, and was widely believed to have been written by a country parson, or perhaps the wife of a parson.\\n', 'Eliot was profoundly influenced by the works of Thomas Carlyle. As early as 1841, she referred to him as \"a grand favourite of mine\", and references to him abound in her letters from the 1840s and 1850s. According to University of Victoria professor Lisa Surridge, Carlyle \"stimulated Eliot\\'s interest in German thought, encouraged her turn from Christian orthodoxy, and shaped her ideas on work, duty, sympathy, and the evolution of the self.\"[41] These themes made their way into Evans\\'s first complete novel, Adam Bede (1859).[40] It was an instant success, and prompted yet more intense curiosity as to the author\\'s identity: there was even a pretender to the authorship, one Joseph Liggins. This public interest subsequently led to Marian Evans Lewes\\'s acknowledgment that it was she who stood behind the pseudonym George Eliot. Adam Bede is known for embracing a realist aesthetic inspired by Dutch visual art.[42]\\n', \"The revelations about Eliot's private life surprised and shocked many of her admiring readers, but this did not affect her popularity as a novelist. Her relationship with Lewes afforded her the encouragement and stability she needed to write fiction, but it would be some time before the couple were accepted into polite society. Acceptance was finally confirmed in 1877 when they were introduced to Princess Louise, the daughter of Queen Victoria. The queen herself was an avid reader of all of Eliot's novels and was so impressed with Adam Bede that she commissioned the artist Edward Henry Corbould to paint scenes from the book.[43]\\n\", \"When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Eliot expressed sympathy for the Union cause, something which historians have attributed to her abolitionist sympathies.[28][29] In 1868, she supported philosopher Richard Congreve's protests against governmental policies in Ireland and had a positive view of the growing movement in support of Irish home rule.[28][29]\\n\", 'She was influenced by the writings of John Stuart Mill and read all of his major works as they were published.[44] In Mill\\'s The Subjection of Women (1869)  she judged the second chapter excoriating the laws which oppress married women \"excellent.\"[29] She was supportive of Mill\\'s parliamentary run, but believed that the electorate was unlikely to vote for a philosopher and was surprised when he won.[28] While Mill served in parliament, she expressed her agreement with his efforts on behalf of female suffrage, being \"inclined to hope for much good from the serious presentation of women\\'s claims before Parliament.\"[45] In a letter to John Morley, she declared her support for plans \"which held out reasonable promise of tending to establish as far as possible an equivalence of advantage for the two sexes, as to education and the possibilities of free development\", and dismissed appeals to nature in explaining women\\'s lower status.[45][29] In 1870, she responded enthusiastically to Lady Amberley\\'s feminist lecture on the claims of women for education, occupations, equality in marriage, and child custody.[29]\\n', 'However, it would not be correct to assume that the female protagonists of her works can be considered \"feminist\", with the sole exception perhaps of Romola de\\' Bardi, who resolutely rejects the State and Church obligations of her time.[46]\\n', 'After the success of Adam Bede, Eliot continued to write popular novels for the next fifteen years. Within a year of completing Adam Bede, she finished The Mill on the Floss, dedicating the manuscript: \"To my beloved husband, George Henry Lewes, I give this MS. of my third book, written in the sixth year of our life together, at Holly Lodge, South Field, Wandsworth, and finished 21 March 1860.\"  Silas Marner (1861) and Romola (1863) soon followed, and later Felix Holt, the Radical (1866) and her most acclaimed novel, Middlemarch (1871–1872).\\n', \"Her last novel was Daniel Deronda, published in 1876, after which she and Lewes moved to Witley, Surrey. By this time Lewes's health was failing, and he died two years later, on 30 November 1878. Eliot spent the next six months editing Lewes's final work, Life and Mind, for publication, and found solace and companionship with longtime friend and financial adviser John Walter Cross, a Scottish commission agent[47] 20 years her junior, whose mother had recently died.\\n\", 'Marriage to John Cross and death[edit]', \"On 16 May 1880, eighteen months after Lewes' death, Eliot married John Walter Cross (1840–1924)[43] and again changed her name, this time to Mary Ann Cross. While the marriage courted some controversy due to the 21 year age differences, it pleased her brother Isaac that she was married in this relationship. He had broken off relations with her when she had begun to live with Lewes, and now sent congratulations. While the couple were honeymooning in Venice, Cross, in a suicide attempt, jumped from the hotel balcony into the Grand Canal. He survived, and the newlyweds returned to England. They moved to a new house in Chelsea, but Eliot fell ill with a throat infection. This, coupled with the kidney disease with which she had been afflicted for several years, led to her death on 22 December 1880 at the age of 61.[48][49]\\n\", 'Due to her denial of the Christian faith and her relationship with Lewes,[citation needed] Eliot was not buried in Westminster Abbey. She was instead interred in Highgate Cemetery (East), Highgate, London, in the area reserved for political and religious dissenters and agnostics, beside the love of her life, George Henry Lewes.[a] The graves of Karl Marx and her friend Herbert Spencer are nearby.[51] In 1980, on the centenary of her death, a memorial stone was established for her in the Poets\\' Corner between W. H. Auden and Dylan Thomas, with a quote from Scenes of Clerical Life: \"The first condition of human goodness is something to love; the second something to reverence\".\\n', 'Personal appearance[edit]', 'George Eliot was a physically unattractive woman; she herself knew this and made jokes about her appearance in letters to friends.[52] Yet somehow the force of her personality overcame her ugliness. This was noted by numerous acquaintances.[52] Of his first meeting with her on 9 May 1869, Henry James wrote:\\n', '... To begin with she is magnificently ugly — deliciously hideous. She has a low forehead, a dull grey eye, a vast pendulous nose, a huge mouth, full of uneven teeth & a chin & jawbone qui n\\'en finissent pas [\"which never end\"] ... Now in this vast ugliness resides a most powerful beauty which, in a very few minutes steals forth & charms the mind, so that you end as I ended, in falling in love with her.[53]\\n', 'Spelling of her name[edit]', '\\nShe spelled her name differently at different times. Mary Anne was the spelling used by her father for the baptismal record and she uses this spelling in her earliest letters. Within her family, however, it was spelled Mary Ann. By 1852, she had changed to Marian,[54] but she reverted to Mary Ann in 1880 after she married John Cross.[55] Her memorial stone reads[56] ', \"Here lies the body of'George Eliot'Mary Ann Cross\", 'Memorials and tributes[edit]', 'Several landmarks in her birthplace of Nuneaton are named in her honour. These include the George Eliot Academy, Middlemarch Junior School, George Eliot Hospital (formerly Nuneaton Emergency Hospital),[57] and George Eliot Road, in Foleshill, Coventry.\\nAlso, The Mary Anne Evans Hospice in Nuneaton.\\n', 'A statue of Eliot is in Newdegate Street, Nuneaton, and Nuneaton Museum & Art Gallery has a display of artifacts related to her.\\n', 'A tunnel boring machine constructing the Bromford Tunnel on High Speed 2 was named in honour of her. [58]\\n', 'Literary assessment[edit]', \"Throughout her career, Eliot wrote with a politically astute pen. From Adam Bede to The Mill on the Floss and Silas Marner, Eliot presented the cases of social outsiders and small-town persecution. Felix Holt, the Radical and The Legend of Jubal were overtly political, and political crisis is at the heart of Middlemarch, in which she presents the stories of a number of inhabitants of a small English town on the eve of the Reform Bill of 1832; the novel is notable for its deep psychological insight and sophisticated character portraits. The roots of her realist philosophy can be found in her review of John Ruskin's Modern Painters in Westminster Review in 1856. Eliot also express proto-Zionist ideas in Daniel Deronda.[59]\\n\", \"Readers in the Victorian era praised her novels for their depictions of rural society. Much of the material for her prose was drawn from her own experience. She shared with Wordsworth the belief that there was much value and beauty to be found in the mundane details of ordinary country life. Eliot did not, however, confine herself to stories of the English countryside. Romola, an historical novel set in late fifteenth century Florence, was based on the life of the Italian priest Girolamo Savonarola. In The Spanish Gypsy, Eliot made a foray into verse, but her poetry's initial popularity has not endured.\\n\", 'Working as a translator, Eliot was exposed to German texts of religious, social, and moral philosophy such as David Friedrich Strauss\\'s Life of Jesus and Feuerbach\\'s The Essence of Christianity; also important was her translation from Latin of Jewish-Dutch philosopher Spinoza\\'s Ethics. Elements from these works show up in her fiction, much of which is written with her trademark sense of agnostic humanism. According to Clare Carlisle, who published a new biography on George Eliot in 2023,[60] the overdue publication of Spinoza\\'s Ethics was a real shame, because it could have provided some illuminating cues for understanding the more mature works of the writer.[34]  She had taken particular notice of Feuerbach\\'s conception of Christianity, positing that our understanding of the nature of the divine was to be found ultimately in the nature of humanity projected onto a divine figure. An example of this philosophy appeared in her novel Romola, in which Eliot’s protagonist displayed a \"surprisingly modern readiness to interpret religious language in humanist or secular ethical terms.\"[61] Though Eliot herself was not religious, she had respect for religious tradition and its ability to maintain a sense of social order and morality. \\nThe religious elements in her fiction also owe much to her upbringing, with the experiences of Maggie Tulliver from The Mill on the Floss sharing many similarities with the young Mary Ann Evans. Eliot also faced a quandary similar to that of Silas Marner, whose alienation from the church simultaneously meant his alienation from society. Because Eliot retained a vestigial respect for religion, German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche excoriated her system of morality for figuring sin as a debt that can be expiated through suffering, which he demeaned as characteristic of \"little moralistic females à la Eliot.\"[62]\\n', 'She was at her most autobiographical in Looking Backwards, part of her final published work Impressions of Theophrastus Such. By the time of Daniel Deronda, Eliot\\'s sales were falling off, and she had faded from public view to some degree. This was not helped by the posthumous biography written by her husband, which portrayed a wonderful, almost saintly, woman totally at odds with the scandalous life people knew she had led. In the 20th century she was championed by a new breed of critics, most notably by Virginia Woolf, who called Middlemarch \"one of the few English novels written for grown-up people\".[4] In 1994, literary critic Harold Bloom placed Eliot among the most important Western writers of all time.[63] In a 2007 authors\\' poll by Time, Middlemarch was voted the tenth greatest literary work ever written.[64] In 2015, writers from outside the UK voted it first among all British novels \"by a landslide\".[65] The various film and television adaptations of Eliot\\'s books have re-introduced her to the wider reading public.\\n', 'Works[edit]', 'Novels[edit]', 'Short story collection and novellas[edit]', 'Translations[edit]', 'Poetry[edit]', 'Non-fiction[edit]', 'Explanatory notes[edit]', \"\\n^ While the biographical consensus is that Lewes and Eliot had a perfect partnership, this view has been somewhat modified by Beverley Park Rilett, who argued in 2013 and 2017 that Lewes's protective love may have amounted to coercive control.[50]\\n\\n\", 'References[edit]', 'Citations[edit]', '\\n^ Ashton, Rosemary (1996).

      "['From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia', 'Contents', 'Blue whale', '\\n', \"The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal and a baleen whale. Reaching a maximum confirmed length of 29.9 meters (98\\xa0ft) and weighing up to 199 tonnes (196 long tons; 219 short tons), it is the largest animal known ever to have existed.[3][a] The blue whale's long and slender body can be of various shades of greyish-blue dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath. Four subspecies are recognized: B. m. musculus in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, B. m. intermedia in the Southern Ocean, B. m. brevicauda (the pygmy blue whale) in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean, and B. m. indica in the Northern Indian Ocean. There is also a population in the waters off Chile that may constitute a fifth subspecies.\\n\", 'In general, blue whale populations migrate between their summer feeding areas near the poles and their winter breeding grounds near the tropics. There is also evidence of year-round residencies, and partial or age/sex-based migration. Blue whales are filter feeders; their diet consists almost exclusively of krill. They are generally solitary or gather in small groups, and have no well-defined social structure other than mother–calf bonds. The fundamental frequency for blue whale vocalizations ranges from 8 to 25\\xa0Hz and the production of vocalizations may vary by region, season, behavior, and time of day. Orcas are their only natural predators.\\n', \"The blue whale was once abundant in nearly all the Earth's oceans until the end of the 19th\\xa0century. It was hunted almost to the point of extinction by whalers until the International Whaling Commission banned all blue whale hunting in 1966. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed blue whales as Endangered as of 2018. It continues to face numerous man-made threats such as ship strikes, pollution, ocean noise, and climate change.[1]\\n\", 'Taxonomy', 'Nomenclature', 'The genus name, Balaenoptera, means winged whale,[7] while the species name, musculus, could mean \"muscle\" or a diminutive form of \"mouse\", possibly a pun by Carl Linnaeus[8][7] when he named the species in Systema Naturae.[9] One of the first published descriptions of a blue whale comes from Robert Sibbald\\'s Phalainologia Nova,[10] after Sibbald found a stranded whale in the estuary of the Firth of Forth, Scotland, in 1692. The name \"blue whale\" was derived from the Norwegian blåhval, coined by Svend Foyn shortly after he had perfected the harpoon gun. The Norwegian scientist G. O. Sars adopted it as the common name in 1874.[11]\\n', 'Blue whales were referred to as \"Sibbald\\'s rorqual\", after Robert Sibbald, who first described the species.[10] Herman Melville called the blue whale \"sulphur bottom\" in his novel Moby Dick[12] because of the accumulation of diatoms creating a yellowish appearance on their pale underside.[8][13]\\n', 'Evolution', 'Minke whale\\n', 'B. musculus (blue whale)\\n', 'B. borealis (sei whale)\\n', 'Eschrichtius robustus (gray whale)\\n', 'B. physalus (fin whale)\\n', 'Megaptera novaeangliae (humpback whale)\\n', 'Blue whales are rorquals in the family Balaenopteridae. A 2018 analysis estimates that the Balaenopteridae family diverged from other families in between 10.48 and 4.98\\xa0million years ago during the late Miocene.[14] The earliest discovered anatomically modern blue whale is a partial skull fossil found in southern Italy, dating to the Early Pleistocene, roughly 1.5–1.25\\xa0million years ago.[15] The Australian pygmy blue whale diverged during the Last Glacial Maximum. Their more recent divergence has resulted in the subspecies having a relatively low genetic diversity,[16] and New Zealand blue whales have an even lower genetic diversity.[17]\\n', 'Whole genome sequencing suggests that blue whales are most closely related to sei whales with gray whales as a sister group. This study also found significant gene flow between minke whales and the ancestors of the blue and sei whale. Blue whales also displayed high genetic diversity.[14]\\n', 'Hybridization', 'Blue whales are known to interbreed with fin whales. The earliest description of a possible hybrid between a blue whale and a fin whale was an 20-meter (65\\xa0ft) anomalous female whale with the features of both the blue and the fin whales taken in the North Pacific.[18] A whale captured off northwestern Spain in 1984, was found to have been the product of a blue whale mother and a fin whale father.[19]\\n', 'Two live blue-fin whale hybrids have since been documented in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Canada), and in the Azores (Portugal).[20] DNA tests done in Iceland on a blue whale killed in July 2018 by the Icelandic whaling company Hvalur hf, found that the whale was the offspring of a male fin whale and female blue whale;[21] however, the results are pending independent testing and verification of the samples. Because the International Whaling Commission classified blue whales as a \"Protection Stock\", trading their meat is illegal, and the kill is an infraction that must be reported.[22] Blue-fin hybrids have been detected from genetic analysis of whale meat samples taken from Japanese markets.[23] Blue-fin whale hybrids are capable of being fertile. Molecular tests on a 21-meter (70\\xa0ft) pregnant female whale caught off Iceland in 1986 found that it had a blue whale mother and a fin whale father, while its fetus was sired by a blue whale.[24]\\n', \"In 2024, a genome analysis of North Atlantic blue whales found evidence that approximately 3.5% of the blue whales' genome was derived from hybridization with fin whales. Gene flow was found to be unidirectional from fin whales to blue whales. Comparison with Antarctic blue whales showed that this hybridization began after the separation of the northern and southern populations. Despite their smaller size, fin whales have similar cruising and sprinting speeds to blue whales, which would allow fin males to complete courtship chases with blue females.[25]\\n\", 'There is a reference to a humpback–blue whale hybrid in the South Pacific, attributed to marine biologist Michael Poole.[7][26]\\n', 'Subspecies and stocks', 'At least four subspecies of blue whale are recognized, some of which are divided into population stocks or \"management units\".[27][28] They have a worldwide distribution, but are mostly absent from the Arctic Ocean and the Mediterranean, Okhotsk, and Bering Sea.[27]\\n', 'Blue whales off the Chilean coast may be a separate subspecies based on geographic separation, genetics, and unique song types.[29][30][31] Chilean blue whales may overlap in the Eastern Tropical Pacific with Antarctica blue whales and Eastern North Pacific blue whales. Chilean blue whales are genetically differentiated from Antarctica blue whales and are unlikely to be interbreeding. However, the genetic distinction is less with the Eastern North Pacific blue whale and there may be gene flow between hemispheres.[32]\\n', 'Description', 'The blue whale is a slender-bodied cetacean with a broad U-shaped head; thin, elongated flippers; a small 33 centimeters (13\\xa0in) sickle-shaped dorsal fin located close to the tail, and a large tail stock at the root of the wide and thin flukes. The upper jaw is lined with 70–395 black baleen plates. The throat region has 60–88 grooves which allows the skin to expand during feeding.[7][8][13][33][34] It has two blowholes that can squirt 9.1–12.2 meters (30–40\\xa0ft) up in the air.[7][13][33] The skin has a mottled grayish-blue coloration, appearing blue underwater.[8][13][33] The mottling patterns near the dorsal fin vary between individuals.[35][36][37] The underbelly has lighter pigmentation and can appear yellowish due to diatoms in the water,[8][13][33] which historically earned them the nickname \"sulphur bottom\".[12][38] The male blue whale has the largest penis in the animal kingdom, at around 3\\xa0m (9.8\\xa0ft) long and 12\\xa0in (30\\xa0cm) wide.[39]\\n', 'Size', 'The blue whale is the largest animal known ever to have existed.[40][41][42] Some studies have estimated that certain shastasaurid ichthyosaurs and the ancient whale Perucetus could have rivalled the blue whale in size, with Perucetus also being heavier than the blue whale with a mean weight of 180\\xa0t (180 long tons; 200 short tons);[43][4] however, these estimates are based on fragmentary remains, and the proposed size for the latter has been disputed in 2024.[5] Likewise, other studies estimate that on land, large sauropods like Bruhathkayosaurus (mean weight: 110–170 tons) and Maraapunisaurus (mean weight: 80–120 tons) would have easily rivalled the blue whale, with the former even exceeding the blue whale based on its most liberal estimations (240 tons); however, these estimates are based on even more fragmentary specimens that had disintegrated by the time those estimates were made.[6]\\n', 'The International Whaling Commission (IWC) whaling database reports 88 individuals longer than 30 meters (98\\xa0ft), including one of 33 meters (108\\xa0ft), but problems with how the measurements were taken suggest that any longer than 30.5 meters (100\\xa0ft) are suspect.[44] The Discovery Committee reported lengths up to 31 meters (102\\xa0ft);[45] however, the longest scientifically measured individual blue whale was 30 meters (98\\xa0ft) from rostrum tip to tail notch.[46] Female blue whales are larger than males.[13][47] Hydrodynamic models suggest a blue whale could not exceed 33 metres (108\\xa0ft) because of metabolic and energy constraints.[48]\\n', 'The average length of sexually mature female blue whales is 22.0 meters (72.1\\xa0ft) for Eastern North Pacific blue whales, 24 meters (79\\xa0ft) for central and western North Pacific blue whales, 21–24 meters (68–78\\xa0ft) for North Atlantic blue whales, 25.4–26.3 meters (83.4–86.3\\xa0ft) for Antarctic blue whales, 23.5 meters (77.1\\xa0ft) for Chilean blue whales, and 21.3 meters (69.9\\xa0ft) for pygmy blue whales.[44][49][50]\\n', 'In the Northern Hemisphere, males weigh an average 100 metric tons (220,000\\xa0lb) and females 112 metric tons (247,000\\xa0lb). Eastern North Pacific blue whale males average 88.5 tonnes (195,000\\xa0lb) and females 100 tonnes (220,000\\xa0lb). Antarctic males average 112 tonnes (247,000\\xa0lb) and females 130 tonnes (290,000\\xa0lb). Pygmy blue whale males average 83.5 tonnes (184,000\\xa0lb) to 99 tonnes (218,000\\xa0lb).[51] The weight of the heart of a stranded North Atlantic blue whale was 180\\xa0kg (400\\xa0lb), the largest known in any animal.[52] The record-holder blue whale was recorded at 173 tonnes (190 short tons),[53] with estimates of up to 199 tonnes (220 short tons).[54]\\n', 'In 2024, Motani and Pyenson calculated the body mass of blue whales at different lengths, compiling records of their sizes from previous academic literatures and using regression analyses and volumetric analyses: a 25 metres (82\\xa0ft) long individual was estimated to weigh approximately 101–119 tonnes (111–131 short tons), while a 30 metres (98\\xa0ft) long individual was estimated to weigh approximately 184–205 tonnes (203–226 short tons). Considering that the largest blue whale was indeed 33 metres (108\\xa0ft) long, they estimated that a blue whale of such length would have weighed approximately 252–273 tonnes (278–301 short tons).[5]\\n', 'Life span', \"Blue whales live around 80–90 years or more.[13][55] Scientists look at a blue whale's earwax or ear plug to estimate its age. Each year, a light and dark layer of wax is laid corresponding with fasting during migration and feeding time. Each set is thus an indicator of age.[56][57][58] The oldest blue whale determined using this method was 110 years old.[55][59] The maximum age of a pygmy blue whale determined this way is 73 years.[60] In addition, female blue whales develop scars or corpora albicantia on their ovaries every time they ovulate.[61] In a female pygmy blue whale, one corpus albicans is formed on average every 2.6 years.[60]\\n\", 'Behaviour and ecology', 'The blue whale is usually solitary, but can be found in pairs. When productivity is high enough, blue whales can be seen in gatherings of more than 50 individuals.[13] Populations may go on long migrations, traveling to their summer feeding grounds towards the poles and then heading to their winter breeding grounds in more equatorial waters.[62] The animals appear to use memory to locate the best feeding areas.[63] There is evidence of alternative strategies, such as year-round residency, and partial (where only some individuals migrate) or age/sex-based migration. Some whales have been recorded feeding in breeding grounds.[64] The traveling speed for blue whales ranges 5–30 kilometers per hour (3.1–18.6\\xa0mph).[13] Their massive size limits their ability to breach.[65]\\n', \"The greatest dive depth reported from tagged blue whales was 315 meters (1,033\\xa0ft).[66] Their theoretical aerobic dive limit was estimated at 31.2 minutes,[67] however, the longest dive measured was 15.2 minutes.[66] The deepest confirmed dive from a pygmy blue whale was 506 meters (1,660\\xa0ft).[68] A blue whale's heart rate can drop to 2 beats per minute (bpm) at deep depths, but upon surfacing, can rise to 37 bpm, which is close to its peak heart rate.[69]\\n\", 'Diet and feeding', \"The blue whale's diet consists almost exclusively of krill.[13] Blue whales capture krill through lunge feeding; they swim towards them at high speeds as they open their mouths up to 80°.[13][66] They may engulf 220 metric tons (220 long tons; 240 short tons) of water at one time.[70] They squeeze the water out through their baleen plates with pressure from the throat pouch and tongue, and swallow the remaining krill.[13][66] Blue whales have been recorded making 180° rolls during lunge-feeding, possibly allowing them to search the prey field and find the densest patches.[71]\\n\", 'While pursuing krill patches, blue whales maximize their calorie intake by increasing the number of lunges while selecting the thickest patches. This provides them enough energy for everyday activities while storing additional energy necessary for migration and reproduction. Blue whales have to engulf densities greater than 100 krill/m³ to maintain the cost of lunge feeding.[66][72] They can consume 34,776–1,912,680 kilojoules (8,312–457,141\\xa0kcal) from one mouthful of krill, which can provide up to 240 times more energy than used in a single lunge.[66] It is estimated that an average-sized blue whale must consume 1,120\\xa0±\\xa0359 kilograms (2,469\\xa0±\\xa0791\\xa0lb) of krill a day.[73][74]\\n', 'Blue whales appear to avoid directly competing with other baleen whales.[75][76][77] Different whale species select different feeding spaces and times as well as different prey species.[70][78][79] In the Southern Ocean, baleen whales appear to feed on Antarctic krill of different sizes, which may lessen competition between them.[80]\\n', 'Reproduction and birth', 'Blue whales generally reach sexual maturity at 8–10 years. In the Northern Hemisphere, the length at which they reach maturity is 21–23 meters (69–75\\xa0ft) for females and 20–21 meters (66–69\\xa0ft) for males. In the Southern Hemisphere, the length of maturity is 23–24 meters (75–79\\xa0ft) and 22 meters (72\\xa0ft) for females and males respectively.[81] Male pygmy blue whales average 18.7 meters (61.4\\xa0ft) at sexual maturity.[82][83] Female pygmy blue whales are 21.0–21.7 meters (68.9–71.2\\xa0ft) in length[49] and roughly 10 years old at the age of sexual maturity.[49][50][84] Little is known about mating behavior, or breeding and birthing areas.[42][81] Blue whales appear to be polygynous, with males competing for females.[81][85] A male blue whale typically trails a female and will fight off potential rivals.[86] The species mates from fall to winter.[42][81]\\n', 'Pregnant females eat roughly four percent of their body weight daily,[87] amounting to 60% of their overall body weight throughout summer foraging periods.[81][88] Gestation may last 10–12 months with calves being 6–7 meters (20–23\\xa0ft) long and weighing 2–3 metric tons (2.0–3.0 long tons; 2.2–3.3 short tons) at birth.[81] Estimates suggest that because calves require 2–4 kilograms (4.4–8.8\\xa0lb) milk per kg of mass gain, blue whales likely produce 220 kilograms (490\\xa0lb) of milk per day (ranging from 110 to 320 kilograms (240 to 710\\xa0lb) of milk per day).[89] The first video of a calf thought to be nursing was filmed in New Zealand in 2016.[90] Calves may be weaned when they reach 6–8 months old at a length of 16 meters (53\\xa0ft).[81] They gain roughly 37,500 pounds (17,000\\xa0kg) during the weaning period.[41] Interbirth periods last two to three years;[81] they average 2.6 years in pygmy blue whales.[60]\\n', 'Vocalizations', 'Blue whales produce some of the loudest and lowest frequency vocalizations in the animal kingdom,[27] and their inner ears appear well adapted for detecting low-frequency sounds.[91] The fundamental frequency for blue whale vocalizations ranges from 8 to 25\\xa0Hz.[92] Blue whale songs vary between populations.[93]\\n', 'Vocalizations produced by the Eastern North Pacific population have been well studied. This population produces pulsed calls (\"A\") and tonal calls (\"B\"), upswept tones that precede type B calls (\"C\") and separate downswept tones (\"D\").[94][95] A and B calls are often produced in repeated co-occurring sequences and sung only by males, suggesting a reproductive function.[95][96] D calls may have multiple functions. They are produced by both sexes during social interactions while feeding.[96][97] and by males when competing for mates.[86]\\n', 'Blue whale calls recorded off Sri Lanka have a three‐unit phrase. The first unit is a 19.8 to 43.5\\xa0Hz pulsive call, and is normally 17.9 ± 5.2 seconds long. The second unit is a 55.9 to 72.4\\xa0Hz FM upsweep that is 13.8 ± 1.1 seconds long. The final unit is 28.5 ± 1.6 seconds long with a tone of 108 to 104.7\\xa0Hz.[98] A blue whale call recorded off Madagascar, a two‐unit phrase,[99] consists of 5–7 pulses with a center frequency of 35.1 ± 0.7\\xa0Hz lasting 4.4 ± 0.5 seconds proceeding a 35 ± 0\\xa0Hz tone that is 10.9 ± 1.1 seconds long.[98] In the Southern Ocean, blue whales produce 18-second vocals which start with a 9-second-long, 27\\xa0Hz tone, and then a 1-second downsweep to 19\\xa0Hz, followed by a downsweep further to 18\\xa0Hz.[100][101] Other vocalizations include 1–4 second long, frequency-modulated calls with a frequency of 80 and 38\\xa0Hz.[101][102]\\n', 'There is evidence that some blue whale songs have temporally declined in tonal frequency.[103][104][105] The vocalization of blue whales in the Eastern North Pacific decreased in tonal frequency by 31% from the early 1960s to the early 21st century.[103][104] The frequency of pygmy blue whales in the Antarctic has decreased by a few tenths of a hertz every year starting in 2002.[105] It is possible that as blue whale populations recover from whaling, there is increasing sexual selection pressure (i.e., a lower frequency indicates a larger body size).[104]\\n', 'Predators and parasites', 'The only known natural predator to blue whales is the orca, although the rate of fatal attacks by orcas is unknown. Photograph-identification studies of blue whales have estimated that a high proportion of the individuals in the Gulf of California have rake-like scars, indicative of encounters with orcas.[106] Off southeastern Australia, 3.7% of blue whales photographed had rake marks and 42.1% of photographed pygmy blue whales off Western Australia had rake marks.[107] Documented predation by orcas has been rare. A blue whale mother and calf were first observed being chased at high speeds by orcas off southeastern Australia.[108] The first documented attack occurred in 1977 off southwestern Baja California, Mexico, but the injured whale escaped after five hours.[109] Four more blue whales were documented as being chased by a group of orcas between 1982 and 2003.[110] The first documented predation event by orcas occurred in September 2003, when a group of orcas in the Eastern Tropical Pacific was encountered feeding on a recently killed blue whale calf.[111] In March 2014, a commercial whale watch boat operator recorded an incident involving a group of orcas harassing a blue whale in Monterey Bay. The blue whale defended itself by slapping its tail.[112] A similar incident was recorded by a drone in Monterey Bay in May 2017.[113] The first direct observations of orca predation occurred off the south coast of Western Australia, two in 2019 and one more in 2021. The first victim was estimated to be 18–22 meters (59–72\\xa0ft).[114]\\n', 'In Antarctic waters, blue whales accumulate diatoms of the species Cocconeis ceticola and the genera Navicola, which are normally removed when the whales enter warmer waters. Other external parasites include barnacles such as Coronula diadema, Coronula reginae, and Cryptolepas rhachianecti, which latch on their skin deep enough to leave behind a pit if removed. Whale lice species make their home in cracks of the skin and are relatively harmless. The copepod species Pennella balaenopterae digs in and attaches itself to the blubber to feed on. Intestinal parasites include the trematode genera Ogmogaster and Lecithodesmus; the tapeworm genera Priapocephalus, Phyllobotrium, Tetrabothrius, Diphyllobotrium, and Diplogonoporus; and the thorny-headed worm genus Bolbosoma. In the North Atlantic, blue whales also contain the protozoans Entamoeba, Giardia and Balantidium.[115]\\n', 'Conservation', 'The global blue whale population is estimated to be 5,000–15,000 mature individuals and 10,000–25,000 total as of 2018. By comparison, there were at least 140,000 mature whales in 1926. There are an estimated total of 1,000–3,000 whales in the North Atlantic, 3,000–5,000 in the North Pacific, and 5,000–8,000 in the Antarctic. There are possibly 1,000–3,000 whales in the eastern South Pacific while the pygmy blue whale may number 2,000–5,000 individuals.[1] Blue whales have been protected in areas of the Southern Hemisphere since 1939. In 1955, they were given complete protection in the North Atlantic under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling; this protection was extended to the Antarctic in 1965 and the North Pacific in 1966.[116][117] The protected status of North Atlantic blue whales was not recognized by Iceland until 1960.[118] In the U.S., the species is protected under the Endangered Species Act.[62]\\n', 'Blue whales are formally classified as endangered under both the U.S. Endangered Species Act[119] and the IUCN Red List.[1] They are also listed on Appendix\\xa0I under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)[120] and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.[121] Although, for some populations, there is not enough information on current abundance trends (e.g., pygmy blue whales), others are critically endangered (e.g., Antarctic blue whales).[122][123]\\n', 'Threats', 'Blue whales were initially difficult to hunt because of their size and speed.[27] This began to change in the mid-19th century with the development of harpoons that can be shot as projectiles.[124] Blue whale whaling peaked between 1930 and 1931 with 30,000 animals taken. Harvesting of the species was particularly high in the Antarctic, with 350,000–360,000 whales taken in the first half of the 20th century. In addition, 11,000 North Atlantic whales (mostly around Iceland) and 9,500 North Pacific whales were killed during the same period.[81] The International Whaling Commission banned all hunting of blue whales in 1966 and gave them worldwide protection.[125] However, the Soviet Union continued to illegally hunt blue whales and other species up until the 1970s.[126]\\n', \"Ship strikes are a significant mortality factor for blue whales, especially off the U.S. West Coast.[127] A total of 17 blue whales were killed or suspected to have been killed by ships between 1998 and 2019 off the U.S. West Coast.[27] Five deaths in 2007 off California were considered an unusual mortality event, as defined under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.[127][128] Lethal ship strikes are also a problem in Sri Lankan waters, where their habitat intersects with one of the world's most active shipping routes.[129] Here, strikes caused the deaths of eleven blue whales in 2010 and 2012,[130] and at least two in 2014.[131] Ship-strike mortality claimed the lives of two blue whales off southern Chile in the 2010s.[132][133] Possible measures for reducing future ship strikes include better predictive models of whale distribution, changes in shipping lanes, vessel speed reductions, and seasonal and dynamic management of shipping lanes.[134][135] Few cases of blue whale entanglement in commercial fishing gear have been documented. The first report in the U.S. occurred off California in 2015, reportedly some type of deep-water trap/pot fishery.[136] Three more entanglement cases were reported in 2016.[137] In Sri Lanka, a blue whale was documented with a net wrapped through its mouth, along the sides of its body, and wound around its tail.[138]\\n\", \"Increasing man-made underwater noise impacts blue whales.[139][140] They may be exposed to noise from commercial shipping[141][142] and seismic surveys as a part of oil and gas exploration.[143][144] Blue whales in the Southern California Bight decreased calling in the presence of mid-frequency active (MFA) sonar.[145] Exposure to simulated MFA sonar was found to interrupt blue whale deep-dive feeding but no changes in behavior were observed in individuals feeding at shallower depths. The responses also depended on the animal's behavioral state, its (horizontal) distance from the sound source and the availability of prey.[146]\\n\", 'The potential impacts of pollutants on blue whales is unknown. However, because blue whales feed low on the food chain, there is a lesser chance for bioaccumulation of organic chemical contaminants.[147] Analysis of the earwax of a male blue whale killed by a collision with a ship off the coast of California showed contaminants like pesticides, flame retardants, and mercury. Reconstructed persistent organic pollutant (POP) profiles suggested that a substantial maternal transfer occurred during gestation and/or lactation.[148] Male blue whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, were found to have higher concentrations of PCBs, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), metabolites, and several other organochlorine compounds relative to females, reflecting maternal transfer of these persistent contaminants from females into young.[149]\\n', 'See also', 'Note', '\\n^ The extinct whale species Perucetus colossus (described in 2023) has been suggested as a potential contender of the blue whale in size,[4] however, this was later disputed in 2024.[5] Several extinct dinosaurs may also have reached a similar mass to the blue whale.[6]\\n\\n', 'References', '\\n^ a b c d Cooke, J.G.

      "['From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia', 'Contents', 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show', '\\n', \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show (stylized as ellen; often shortened to Ellen or The Ellen Show) is  an American daytime television variety comedy talk show. Created and hosted by its namesake Ellen DeGeneres, it aired for 19 seasons from September 8, 2003, to June 3, 2022, in syndication and was produced by Telepictures. The majority of stations owned by NBC Owned Television Stations, along with Hearst Television and Tegna, served as the program's largest affiliate base.[3] For its first five seasons, the show was taped in Studio 11 at NBC Studios in Burbank, California. From season 6 onwards, the show moved to being taped at Stage 1 on the nearby Warner Bros. lot.[4] Since the beginning of the sixth season, The Ellen DeGeneres Show was broadcast in high definition.\\n\", \"The show received 171 Daytime Emmy Award nominations and won 63 Daytime Emmy Awards as of 2022, including four for Outstanding Talk Show and seven for Outstanding Talk Show Entertainment, making 11 total awards and surpassing the record held by The Oprah Winfrey Show, which won nine as Outstanding Talk Show before it was divided into two categories (Informative and Entertainment) in 2008. The show also won 17 People's Choice Awards. On May 21, 2019, DeGeneres announced she had signed for three more years, renewing the show through 2022.[5][6][7][8] The eighteenth season premiered on September 21, 2020.[9] On May 12, 2021, DeGeneres announced that the nineteenth season would be her last,[10] which premiered on September 13, 2021.[11]\\n\", \"The final episode aired on June 3, 2022, as previously announced on March 17, 2022.[12][13][14] New episodes with guest hosts, clip shows hosted by DeGeneres and more, and repeats aired on stations across the United States until September 9, after which most stations (including NBC O&O) began occupying the show's time slot with new newscasts or syndication programs such as The Kelly Clarkson Show.\\n\", 'Concept[edit]', 'The program combines comedy, celebrity, musical guests, and human-interest stories. The program often features audience participation games where prizes are awarded. During her Twelve Days of Giveaways promotion, audience members receive roughly $3,000 worth of prizes on each of twelve episodes. Because the show has become so popular, not all who arrive hoping to see a taping can fit into the studio, so an offshoot space, dubbed by Tom Hanks \"The Riff Raff Room\", was created. People seated here are often referenced and shown briefly on camera but watch the taping from off-stage. Other non-celebrities have been featured in an attempt by DeGeneres to give them 15 minutes of fame. Guests in this role have included intelligent children and small business owners. In the show\\'s third season, DeGeneres began surprising fans by introducing them to their favorite celebrities.\\n', 'Recurring elements[edit]', 'Several recurring sounds, gags, and catchphrases are used by DeGeneres depending on the topic of discussion or theme for a specific episode. For example, after DeGeneres says the phrase, \"Aww Snap!\", a sound effect of a whip cracking often is played. In her monologue, DeGeneres frequently thanks the audience\\'s applause by saying \"I feel the same way about you!\" Other video segments include DeGeneres scaring people, playing pranks, taking part in faux-breaking news segments and interacting with crew members. Other recurring segments include those where DeGeneres comments on Internet videos, tabloid-style photographs of celebrities, advertisements on Craigslist, or voicemails left for her on an answering machine. Some segments feature audience members more prominently, including having audience members show hidden talents, pictures of others that resemble DeGeneres, and interviewing children.\\n', 'DeGeneres frequently plays games with audience members and awards prizes based upon their performance. Games have included Pictionary-style drawing games, finding hidden objects within the studio, category, current event or pop-culture-based trivia, and various other stunt and charade-based games. DeGeneres also joked several times on the show about when a sequel to Finding Nemo, in which she famously had a lead role, would eventually release, as well as make references to the film. Eventually, the sequel, Finding Dory, was officially announced by DeGeneres.\\n', 'Segments (including former and recurring)[edit]', 'The show has many recurring segments throughout the years. Some include:\\n', 'Heads Up!\\n\\n', \"Heads Up! is a game that DeGeneres plays with other celebrities. Originally, the game had players guess words or phrases on physical cards held to their foreheads by watching the other players act it out or give hints as time counted down. Later, DeGeneres and Warner Bros. Entertainment developed an app version of the game. The app became a huge success after its May 2013 launch, rising to the top of the App Store with over 650,000 downloads during its first month. By July 2016, it had been downloaded more than 25 million times and remained one of Apple's top-paid apps.[19]\\n\", 'Dancing[edit]', \"Since the show's debut, DeGeneres has segued from her opening monologue by doing a dance. The dancing proved to be extremely popular with viewers, and has since progressed to a segment where DeGeneres dances into the audience, sometimes borrowing a coat or purse from someone's chair, and taking it with her. She has also featured a segment in which people teach her new dance moves.\\n\", \"One of her most famous dance moves is dancing over the table, where she straddles the coffee table and dances from one end to the other. Although she does not do it every day, dancing over the table is a recurring theme. As an April Fools' Day prank in 2009, the show's staff placed a wider table top over her normal table. During the show, when DeGeneres attempted to dance over it, she barely made it across, being forced on her tip-toes and using the table as leverage. On the seventh-season premiere, DeGeneres performed a dance segment with the cast of So You Think You Can Dance.\\n\", 'In September 2009, four major record labels sued the producers of the show for unspecified damages over the dance routine, for allegedly using songs without permission.[20]\\n', \"In 2018, The New York Times profiled DeGeneres as she faced decisions of renewing her talkshow contract, and exploring other outlets for her creativity including her Netflix comedy special Relatable (2018), which spoofs her kind image.[21] They noted that she felt boxed in with a reputation of always being nice, and the host who danced all time.[21] DeGeneres—who acknowledges she has always been over-sensitive—fretted how her audience would react when she no longer wanted to dance.[21] Her Christian Scientist upbringing included her father's psyche, “He was a very fearful man, he couldn't hear or engage with anything unpleasant.”[21]\\n\", 'Sophia Grace and Rosie[edit]', 'Sophia Grace Brownlee (born April 18, 2003[22]) and her cousin Rosie McClelland (born September 7, 2006[23]) were first invited to the show after DeGeneres saw their YouTube video cover of \"Super Bass\" by Nicki Minaj, which Sophia Grace and Rosie posted on YouTube on September 19, 2011.[24] The then eight- and five-year-old Essex, England natives became recurring cast members on the show, where they hosted their own segment called \"Tea Time with Sophia Grace and Rosie\". In the segment, the duo invites and interviews guest celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Hugh Grant, Julie Bowen, Harry Connick Jr., LL Cool J, Justin Bieber, and Reese Witherspoon over to tea. Sophia Grace and Rosie won the \"Choice Webstar\" at the 2012 Teen Choice Awards for this segment. They have also been correspondents during the red carpet events such as the Grammy Awards, the American Music Awards, the Billboard Music Awards, and the MTV Video Music Awards. They appeared in the third episode (June 2013) and the eleventh episode (September 2013) of Sam & Cat. According to her representative, Sophia Grace had been cast as Little Red Riding Hood in Walt Disney Pictures\\' film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim\\'s Into the Woods, but she withdrew before production.[25] Sophia Grace and Rosie starred in their own movie called Sophia Grace and Rosie\\'s Royal Adventure.\\n', 'Production information[edit]', 'Taping location[edit]', 'From 2003 to early 2008, the program was originally taped in Studio 11 at NBC Studios in Burbank, California. It was then filmed in Studio 1 (named \"The Ellen Stage\" since her 2,000th show, which took place in November 2015) on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank.\\n', 'Personnel[edit]', 'The executive producers were DeGeneres, Mary Connelly, Ed Glavin, Andy Lassner, and (until his death in 2012) Jim Paratore. The writing staff has included Karen Kilgariff (former head writer), Karen Anderson, Margaret Smith, and DeGeneres. Margaret Smith left the show to work on her own projects, including her first book, What Was I Thinking? How Being a Stand Up Did Nothing to Prepare Me to Become a Single Mother (Crossroad Publishing, 2008). Amy Rhodes, a former writer for the program, regularly appeared on camera during various segments.\\n', 'DJ[edit]', 'Unlike most talk shows, the show used a disc jockey to supply music rather than a band. Originally, the role was filled by Los Angeles-based DJ Scott K, who lasted only a few weeks. He was later replaced by Tony Okungbowa, who DJed through season 3. Due to his growing acting career, Okungbowa left the show, and a few guest DJs were brought in to try out for the position. Tony was replaced by actor/DJ Jon Abrahams for the fourth-season premiere. Abrahams stayed on the show for one season, and also left as his acting career grew. Ted Stryker of KROQ, was the DJ for the fifth season. Stryker stayed for one season until Okungbowa returned. In a 2012 episode, DJ Pauly D from Jersey Shore deejayed when Okungbowa was promoting his CD.\\n', 'Starting in season 11, several episodes include celebrity \"guest DJs\" filling the DJ position in Okungbowa\\'s absence. Stephen \"tWitch\" Boss of So You Think You Can Dance fame had been Ellen\\'s permanent DJ for several years. After the series completed in 2022, Stephen \"tWitch\" Boss died on December 13, 2022.\\n', 'Okungbowa made a return appearance on the show in the April 28, 2014, episode, while Loni made a return in the June 5, 2015, episode.[citation needed]\\n', '2007 Writers Guild strike[edit]', \"\\nDeGeneres, a member of the Writers Guild of America, supported the 2007 writers' strike.[26] However, on November 9, 2007, DeGeneres crossed the picket line to tape more episodes of her TV show stating: \", \"It was explained to me that no other daytime shows have shut down. I've got 135 employees that rely on me for a paycheck. But it's been the hardest thing in the world driving onto this lot.[26]\", 'DeGeneres decided to abstain from doing a monologue on her show (which is typically written by WGA writers) during the strike.[27] Her show continued production as normal with the exception of her monologue being omitted. The WGAE issued a statement condemning DeGeneres, stating she was \"not welcome in NY.\"[28] DeGeneres\\'s representatives asserted that she did not violate the WGA\\'s agreement, arguing that she is competing with other first-run syndicated shows like Dr. Phil and Live with Regis and Kelly during the competitive November sweeps period, and that DeGeneres must fulfill her duties as host and producer, lest her show lose its time slot or be held in breach of contract. In addition, a statement defending DeGeneres was subsequently issued by AFTRA, pointing out that DeGeneres also works under the AFTRA TV Code, which bars her from striking. The WGAE then issued a response pointing out that DeGeneres is also a Writers Guild member, and that any writing work she did on her show during the strike constituted struck work.[29][30]\\n', 'COVID-19 pandemic[edit]', 'On March 11, 2020, DeGeneres announced via Twitter that for now she would be shooting her show without a studio audience to protect the health and safety of the fans, staff, and crew.[31] In a tweet dated March 13, 2020, DeGeneres announced that production of the show had been suspended until March 30, 2020, to protect the health of her audience and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.[32] Starting on April 6, 2020, the show was produced from her own home.[33][34]\\n', 'On April 16, 2020, Variety reported that crew members had accused the show of not communicating about their pay during the pandemic-induced shutdown.[35]\\n', 'For the 18th-season premiere, DeGeneres returned to the studio with a virtual audience, and a 6-foot table between DeGeneres and her guests.\\n', 'For the 19th-season premiere, the live audience returned wearing masks.

      "['From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia', 'Contents', 'LauncherOne', '\\n', 'LauncherOne was a two-stage orbital launch vehicle developed and flown by Virgin Orbit that had operational flights from 2021 to 2023, after being in development from 2007 to 2020. It was an air-launched rocket, designed to carry smallsat payloads of up to 300\\xa0kg (660\\xa0lb) into Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO),[3] following air launch from a carrier aircraft at high altitude. The rocket was carried to the upper atmosphere on a modified Boeing 747-400, named Cosmic Girl, and released over ocean. Initial work on the program was done by Virgin Galactic, another Virgin Group subsidiary, before a separate entity — Virgin Orbit — was formed in 2017 to complete development and operate the launch service provider business separately from the passenger-carrying Virgin Galactic business.\\n', 'The first successful flight was on 17 January 2021, which delivered a payload of 10 CubeSats to low Earth orbit (LEO).[6] Three further launches successfully reached orbit. An initial test flight was unsuccessful on 25 May 2020, when the rocket failed to reach space.[7] The final flight on 9 January 2023 also failed to reach orbit.\\n', 'LauncherOne was the first all liquid-fuelled air-launched orbital rocket.[8]\\n', 'From 2007 to 2015, Virgin had intended LauncherOne to be a somewhat smaller vehicle with a 200\\xa0kg (440\\xa0lb) payload to low Earth orbit. In 2015, Virgin modified the vehicle design to better target their intended market, and increased the vehicle payload capacity to 300\\xa0kg (660\\xa0lb) launched to a 500\\xa0km (310\\xa0mi) Sun-synchronous orbit, suitable for CubeSats and small payloads. Virgin Orbit targeted a launch price around US$12 million for the rocket.[2]\\n', 'With Virgin Orbit shutting down all operations after bankruptcy in 2023, the vehicle is unlikely to see additional launches.[9]\\n', 'History[edit]', \"Virgin Galactic began working on the LauncherOne concept in 2007,[10] and the technical specifications were first described in some detail in late 2009.[11] The LauncherOne configuration was proposed to be an expendable, two-stage, liquid-fueled rocket air-launched from a White Knight Two carrier aircraft.[12] This would make it a similar configuration to that used by Orbital Sciences' Pegasus, or a smaller version of the StratoLaunch air-launched rocket system.\\n\", 'By 2012, several commercial customers had signed early contracts for launches signaling demand-side support for new small commercial-oriented launch vehicles. These included GeoOptics, Skybox Imaging, Spaceflight Services, and Planetary Resources. Both Surrey Satellite Technology and Sierra Nevada Space Systems were at the time reported to be developing satellite buses \"optimized to the design of LauncherOne\".[13][14] In October 2012, Virgin announced that LauncherOne would be designed so that it could place 200\\xa0kg (440\\xa0lb) in Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO).[15] Virgin planned at the time to market the 200\\xa0kg (440\\xa0lb) payload delivery to Sun-synchronous orbit for under US$10 million per mission,[13] while the maximum payload for low Earth orbit (LEO) missions would be somewhat larger at 500\\xa0kg (1,100\\xa0lb).[16]\\n', 'Under plans announced in 2012, the second stage was to be powered by NewtonOne, a 16\\xa0kN (3,600\\xa0lbf) thrust engine, and the first stage by a scaled-up version called NewtonTwo, with 211\\xa0kN (47,000\\xa0lbf) of thrust. Design and construction of the first engines was completed by 2014. NewtonOne was tested up to a full-duration burn of five minutes. NewtonTwo made several short-duration firings by early 2014.[16] Ultimately, however, neither NewtonOne nor NewtonTwo would be used on LauncherOne.\\n', 'In 2015, Virgin Galactic established a 14,000\\xa0m2 (150,000\\xa0sq\\xa0ft) research, development, and manufacturing center for LauncherOne at Long Beach Airport, California.[17] The company reported in March 2015, that they were on schedule to begin test flights of LauncherOne with its NewtonThree engine by the end of 2016,[18] but they did not achieve that objective.\\n', 'On 25 June 2015, the company signed a contract with OneWeb Ltd. for 39 satellite launches for its satellite constellation with an option for an additional 100 launches,[19] but in 2018 OneWeb canceled all but four, prompting a lawsuit from Virgin Orbit.[20] OneWeb filed for bankruptcy protection in 2020.[21]\\n', \"News reports in September 2015 indicated that the heavier payload of 200\\xa0kg (440\\xa0lb) was to be achieved by longer fuel tanks and use of the recently qualified NewtonThree engine, but this also meant that the Virgin-developed carrier aircraft White Knight Two would no longer be able to lift the rocket to launch altitude, so in December 2015, Virgin announced a change to the carrier plane for LauncherOne to carry the heavier payload. The carrier aircraft subsequently was changed to a used Boeing 747-400,[22] Cosmic Girl, previously operated by Virgin Galactic's sister company, Virgin Atlantic, and purchased outright by Virgin Group from Boeing upon the expiration of that airframe's lease. The 747 will allow a larger LauncherOne to carry the heavier payloads. The modification work on the company's 747 was expected to be completed in 2016, to be followed by orbital test launches of the rocket in 2017.[23][24][25]\\n\", 'It was further announced in December 2015 that the revised LauncherOne would utilize the larger NewtonThree rocket engine on the booster stage, with the NewtonFour powering the second stage.[23] NewtonThree was to be a 260–335\\xa0kN (58,000–75,000\\xa0lbf)-thrust engine, and began hot-fire testing by March 2015.[18][26] The NewtonFour engine would power the second stage. NewtonThree generate 326.8\\xa0kN (73,500\\xa0lbf) of thrust while NewtonFour deliver 26.5\\xa0kN (6,000\\xa0lbf) to the second stage and is capable of multiple restarts.[27]\\n', 'On 2 March 2017, Virgin Galactic announced that its 200-member LauncherOne team was being spun off into a new company called Virgin Orbit.[28] A subsidiary company of Virgin Orbit called Vox Space was created to carry out business which require strict security requirements.[29][30] As of 2017[update], the company planned to fly approximately twice a month by 2020.[31]\\n', 'In September 2017, the first test flights of LauncherOne were delayed to 2018.[31] By June 2018, the Virgin Orbit captive carry flight testing campaign for LauncherOne, including a planned drop test of an unfueled rocket, was licensed to begin in July 2018, and could run for up to six months.[27]\\n', 'In the event, no LauncherOne test flights occurred in 2018 and were delayed further, to December 2019, with only the carrier aircraft beginning to fly in 2018. The first three test flights of Cosmic Girl, including the pylon but not the rocket, happened on 23, 25 and 27 August 2018.[32][33] A high-speed taxi test, with a rocket mounted beneath the aircraft, took place in early November 2018.[34] The aircraft flew its first test flight with both pylon and rocket attached on 18 November 2018.[35][36]\\n', 'Virgin Orbit announced many upgrade and expansion plans that were not finished, such as a 3 stages variant.[37] On 17 March 2022 Polish Space Agency and Virgin Orbit signed an agreement to use LauncherOne as means to send satellites into orbit, with its first launch from Poland planned for 2023.[38]\\n', 'Its parent, Virgin Orbit, declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 4, 2023.[39]\\n', 'Flights[edit]', 'The maiden flight of LauncherOne took place on 25 May 2020. The flight failed a few seconds after the ignition of the rocket due to a premature shutdown of the first stage engine, caused by a break in a propellant feed line,[40] and the rocket did not reach space. The launch failure was attributed to a failure of a high-pressure liquid oxygen fuel line in the NewtonThree engine. Due to the failure, oxygen was no longer supplied to the engine and the flight was terminated. The issue with the fuel line was addressed by strengthening the broken components.[41][42]\\n', \"The second launch took place on 17 January 2021, and was the first to successfully reach orbit.[6] The rocket deployed 10 CubeSats for NASA's Educational Launch of Nanosatellites mission (ELaNa 20).[43] Cosmic Girl took off from Mojave Air and Space Port in California at 18:38 UTC. The aircraft launched the LauncherOne rocket at 19:39 UTC.[8] The launch occurred at the altitude of 10,700\\xa0m (35,100\\xa0ft).[44] On 17 January 2021, both NewtonThree and NewtonFour performed as expected.[43] During launch, NewtonFour fired twice; once to inject the second stage and the payloads into a transfer orbit, and again to circularize the orbit.[43][45]\\n\", 'On 9 January 2023, the first UK launch and final launch for the rocket took place, but it was unsuccessful due to an issue in the upper segment of the rocket.[46]\\n', 'Design[edit]', 'LauncherOne is a two-stage air-launched vehicle. The rocket had a diameter of 1.6\\xa0m (5\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in) for the first stage and 1.3\\xa0m (4\\xa0ft 3\\xa0in) for the second stage and payload fairing.[4]\\n', 'On the 24th of October 2019, the company announced plans to develop a three-stage variant that would be capable of launching 100\\xa0kg (220\\xa0lb) to the Moon, 70\\xa0kg (150\\xa0lb) to Venus, or 50\\xa0kg (110\\xa0lb) to Mars.[37]\\n', 'Engines[edit]', 'LauncherOne is a two-stage air-launched vehicle using Newton engines, RP-1/LOX liquid rocket engines. The second stage was to be powered by NewtonOne, a 211\\xa0kN (47,000\\xa0lbf) thrust engine. It was originally intended that the first stage will be powered by a scaled-up design of the same basic technology as NewtonOne, called NewtonTwo, with 211.5\\xa0kN (47,500\\xa0lbf) of thrust. Both engines had been designed, and as of January\\xa02014[update] first articles were built. NewtonOne was tested up to a full-duration burn of five minutes. NewtonTwo made several short-duration firings by early 2014.[16]\\n', 'NewtonThree is a 260–335\\xa0kN (58,000–75,000\\xa0lbf)-thrust engine, and began hot-fire tests as of March\\xa02015[update]. NewtonThree powered the first stage of LauncherOne.[18][47]\\n', '2015 redesign: new engines, larger payloads, new carrier aircraft[edit]', 'News reports in September 2015 indicated that the higher payload is to be achieved by longer fuel tanks and the NewtonThree engine but this will mean that White Knight Two would no longer be able to lift it to launch altitude. The rocket was to be carried to launch altitude by a Boeing 747.[48][49] The revised LauncherOne utilizes both the Newton 3 and Newton 4 rocket engines.[23]\\n', 'In December 2015, Virgin announced a change to the carrier plane for LauncherOne, as well as a substantially-larger design point for the rocket itself. The carrier aircraft will now be a Boeing 747, which will in turn allow a larger LauncherOne to carry heavier payloads than previously planned. The modification work on the particular Boeing 747 that Virgin has purchased is expected to be completed in 2016, to be followed by Orbital test launches of the rocket in 2017.[23]\\n', 'Intended usage[edit]', 'LauncherOne is designed to launch a 300\\xa0kg (660\\xa0lb) payload to a 500\\xa0km (310\\xa0mi) Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO), suitable for CubeSats and small payloads.[50][51] Virgin Orbit has also announced the ability of LauncherOne to send payloads into heliocentric orbit for flybys of Mars, Venus or asteroids.[52]\\n', 'Launch sites[edit]', 'Virgin Orbit integrated payloads at their headquarters in Long Beach, California.[3]\\n', \"LauncherOne launched from the Cosmic Girl Boeing 747-400 carrier, attached to a pylon on the aircraft's left wing, and released over the ocean at a location depending on the desired orbital inclination. This process avoids typical delays for ground launches due to weather and upper-level winds.[3] William Pomerantz of Virgin Orbit  stated that any airport that can support a Boeing 747 could have been used, subject to local legislation.[53]\\n\", 'The carrier plane lifted off from the Mojave Air and Space Port in California, United States and Newquay Airport in Cornwall, United Kingdom. The company also had plans to use other airports such as Kennedy Space Center in Florida and Alcântara Space Center in Brazil that never materialized. Other proposed launch sites included Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport in Hawaii, José Aponte de la Torre Airport in Puerto Rico,[54] Oita Airport in Japan, Andersen Air Force Base in Guam[55] and Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport in Australia.[56]\\n', 'Past launches[edit]', 'Not materialized launches[edit]', 'Launch statistics[edit]', 'Launch outcomes[edit]', 'Launch sites[edit]', '\\n', 'See also[edit]', 'References[edit]', '\\n^ Dawkins, David. \"Inside Virgin Orbit, Richard Branson\\'s Small Satellite Bid To Match Musk And Bezos In The Billionaire Space Race\".

At the time, the United States was a neutral country in the World War II conflict. The attack on Hawaii and other U.S. territories led the United States to formally enter World War II on the side of the Allies the day following the attack, on December 8, 1941. The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI,[nb 4] and as Operation Z during its planning.[14][15][16]\\n', \"The Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor was preceded by months of negotiations between the United States and Japan over the future of the Pacific. Japanese demands included that the United States end its sanctions against Japan, cease aiding China in the Second Sino-Japanese war, and allow Japan to access the resources of the Dutch East Indies. Anticipating a negative response, Japan sent out its naval attack groups in November 1941 just prior to receiving the Hull note—which states the United States desire that Japan withdraw from China and French Indochina. Japan intended the attack as a preventive action. Its aim was to prevent the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. Over the course of seven hours, Japan conducted coordinated attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island; and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong.[17]\\n\", 'The attack on Pearl Harbor started at 7:48\\xa0a.m. Hawaiian time (6:18\\xa0p.m. GMT).[nb 5] The base was attacked by 353 Imperial Japanese aircraft (including fighters, level and dive bombers, and torpedo bombers) in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers.[18] Of the eight United States Navy battleships present, all were damaged and four were sunk. All but USS\\xa0Arizona were later raised, and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship,[nb 6] and one minelayer. More than 180 US aircraft were destroyed.[20] A total of 2,393 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded, making it the deadliest event ever recorded in Hawaii.[21] Important base installations, such as the power station, dry dock, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section) were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines were lost, and 129 servicemen killed.[7][8] Kazuo Sakamaki, the commanding officer of one of the submarines, was captured.\\n', 'Japan declared war on the United States and the British Empire later that day (December 8 in Tokyo), but the declarations were not delivered until the following day. The British government declared war on Japan immediately after learning that their territory had also been attacked, while the following day (December 8), the United States Congress declared war on Japan. On December 11, though they had no formal obligation to do so under the Tripartite Pact with Japan, Germany and Italy each declared war on the United States, which responded with a declaration of war against Germany and Italy.\\n', 'While there were historical precedents for the unannounced military action by Japan, the lack of any formal warning, as required by the Hague Convention of 1907, and the perception that the attack had been unprovoked, led then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the opening line of his speech to a Joint Session of Congress the following day, to famously label December 7, 1941, \"a date which will live in infamy\".\\n', 'Background', 'Diplomacy', 'War between the Empire of Japan and the United States was seen as a possibility since the 1920s. Japan had been wary of American territorial and military expansion in the Pacific and Asia since the late 1890s, followed by the annexation of islands, such as Hawaii and the Philippines, which they felt were close to or within their sphere of influence.[22][page\\xa0needed][23][page\\xa0needed][24][25]\\n', 'At the same time, Japanese strategic thinkers believed that Japan needed economic self-sufficiency in order to wage modern war. The experiences of World War I had taught the Japanese that modern wars would be protracted, require total mobilization and create vulnerabilities for trade embargoes and encirclement. As a consequence, Japan needed access to strategically important resources (e.g. iron, oil) that could not be extracted at sufficient levels in the home islands.[26][27]\\n', 'Although Japan had begun to take a hostile stance against the United States after the rejection of the Racial Equality Proposal,[28] the relationship between the two countries was cordial enough that they remained trading partners.[29][30] Tensions did not seriously grow until Japan\\'s invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Over the next decade, Japan expanded into China, leading to the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Japan spent considerable effort trying to isolate China and endeavored to secure enough independent resources to attain victory on the mainland. The \"Southern Operation\" was designed to assist these efforts.[23][page\\xa0needed][31][page\\xa0needed]\\n', 'Starting in December 1937, events such as the Japanese attack on USS Panay, the Allison incident, and the Nanking Massacre swung Western public opinion sharply against Japan. The United States unsuccessfully proposed a joint action with the United Kingdom to blockade Japan.[32] In 1938, following an appeal by President Roosevelt, American companies stopped providing Japan with implements of war.[33]\\n', 'In 1940, Japan invaded French Indochina, attempting to stymie the flow of supplies reaching China. The United States halted shipments of airplanes, parts, machine tools, and aviation gasoline to Japan, which the latter perceived as an unfriendly act.[nb 7] The United States did not stop oil exports, however, partly because of the prevailing sentiment in Washington that given Japanese dependence on American oil, such an action was likely to be considered an extreme provocation.[22][page\\xa0needed][35]\\n', \"In mid-1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved the Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Hawaii.[36] He also ordered a military buildup in the Philippines, taking both actions in the hope of discouraging Japanese aggression in the Far East. Because the Japanese high command was mistakenly certain any attack on the United Kingdom's Southeast Asian colonies, including Singapore,[37] would bring the United States into the war, a devastating preventive strike appeared to be the only way to prevent American naval interference.[38][page\\xa0needed] An invasion of the Philippines was also considered necessary by Japanese war planners. The American War Plan Orange had envisioned defending the Philippines with an elite force of 40,000 men; this option was never implemented due to opposition from Douglas MacArthur, who felt he would need a force ten times that size.[citation needed] By 1941, American planners expected to have to abandon the Philippines at the outbreak of war. Late that year, Admiral Thomas C. Hart, commander of the United States Asiatic Fleet, was given orders to that effect.[39]\\n\", 'The United States finally ceased oil exports to Japan in July 1941, following the seizure of French Indochina[40] after the Fall of France, in part because of new American restrictions on domestic oil consumption.[41] Because of this decision, Japan proceeded with plans to take the oil-rich Dutch East Indies.[nb 8] On August 17, Roosevelt warned Japan that America was prepared to take opposing steps if \"neighboring countries\" were attacked.[43][page\\xa0needed]\\n', 'Japan and the United States engaged in negotiations during 1941, attempting to improve relations. In the course of these negotiations, Japan offered to withdraw from most of China and Indochina after making peace with the Nationalist government. It also proposed to adopt an independent interpretation of the Tripartite Pact and to refrain from trade discrimination, provided all other nations reciprocated. Washington rejected these proposals. Japanese Prime Minister Konoe then offered to meet with Roosevelt, but Roosevelt insisted on reaching an agreement before any meeting.[43][page\\xa0needed][44] The American ambassador to Japan repeatedly urged Roosevelt to accept the meeting, warning that it was the only way to preserve the conciliatory Konoe government and peace in the Pacific.[45] However, his recommendation was not acted upon. The Konoe government collapsed the following month when the Japanese military rejected a withdrawal of all troops from China.[46]\\n', \"Japan's final proposal, delivered on November 20, offered to withdraw from southern Indochina and to refrain from attacks in Southeast Asia, so long as the United States, United Kingdom, and Netherlands supplied one\\xa0million U.S. gallons (3.8\\xa0million liters) of aviation fuel, lifted their sanctions against Japan, and ceased aid to China.[47][46] The American counter-proposal of November 26 (November 27 in Japan), the Hull note, required Japan to completely evacuate China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with Pacific powers. On November 26 in Japan, the day before the note's delivery, the Japanese task force left port for Pearl Harbor.[48]\\n\", 'The Japanese intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with their planned military actions in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. Over the course of seven hours, there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the American-held Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong.[17] From the Japanese point of view, it was seen as a preemptive strike \"before the oil gauge ran empty.\"[22][page\\xa0needed]\\n', 'Military planning', 'Preliminary planning for an attack on Pearl Harbor to protect the move into the \"Southern Resource Area\", the Japanese term for the Dutch East Indies and Southeast Asia generally, began early in 1941 under the auspices of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, then commanding Japan\\'s Combined Fleet.[49][50] He won assent to formal planning and training for an attack from the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff only after much contention with Naval Headquarters, including a threat to resign his command.[51] Full-scale planning was underway by early spring 1941, primarily by Rear Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka, with assistance from Commander Minoru Genda and Yamamoto\\'s Deputy Chief of Staff, Captain Kameto Kuroshima.[52] The planners studied the 1940 British air attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto intensively.[nb 9][nb 10]\\n', 'Over the next several months, pilots were trained, equipment was adapted, and intelligence was collected. Despite these preparations, Emperor Hirohito did not approve the attack plan until November 5, after the third of four Imperial Conferences called to consider the matter.[55] At first, he hesitated to engage in war but eventually authorized the Pearl Harbor strike despite dissent from certain advisors.[56] Final authorization was not given by the emperor until December 1, after a majority of Japanese leaders advised him the Hull note would \"destroy the fruits of the China incident, endanger Manchukuo and undermine Japanese control of Korea\".[57]  Before the attack, he became more involved in military matters, even joining the Conference of Military Councillors, which was considered unusual for him.[56] Additionally, he actively sought more information about the war plans.[56] According to an aide, he openly displayed happiness upon hearing about the success of the surprise attacks.[56]\\n', 'By late 1941, many observers believed that hostilities between the United States and Japan were imminent. A Gallup poll just before the attack on Pearl Harbor found that 52% of Americans expected war with Japan, 27% did not, and 21% had no opinion.[58] While American Pacific bases and facilities had been placed on alert on many occasions, officials doubted Pearl Harbor would be the first target; instead, they expected the Philippines to be attacked first. This presumption was due to the threat that the air bases throughout the country and the naval base at Manila posed to sea lanes, as well as to the shipment of supplies to Japan from territory to the south.[nb 11] They also incorrectly believed that Japan was not capable of mounting more than one major naval operation at a time.[38][page\\xa0needed]\\n', 'Objectives', 'The Japanese attack had several major aims. First, it intended to destroy important American fleet units, thereby preventing the Pacific Fleet from interfering with the Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies and Malaya and enabling Japan to conquer Southeast Asia without interference. The leaders of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) ascribed to Alfred Thayer Mahan\\'s \"decisive battle\" doctrine, especially that of destroying the maximum number of battleships. Second, it was hoped to buy time for Japan to consolidate its position and increase its naval strength before shipbuilding authorized by the 1940 Vinson-Walsh Act erased any chance of victory.[60][61] Third, to deliver a blow to America\\'s ability to mobilize its forces in the Pacific, battleships were chosen as the main targets, since they were the prestige ships of navies at the time.[60] Finally, it was hoped that the attack would undermine American morale to such an extent that the American government would drop its demands contrary to Japanese interests and seek a peace compromise.[62][page\\xa0needed][63][page\\xa0needed]\\n', \"Striking the Pacific Fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor had two distinct disadvantages: the targeted ships would be in very shallow water, so it would be relatively easy to salvage and possibly repair them, and most of the crews would survive the attack since many would be on shore leave or would be rescued from the harbor. A further important disadvantage was the absence of all three of the Pacific Fleet's aircraft carriers (Enterprise, Lexington, and Saratoga). Despite these concerns, Yamamoto decided to press ahead.[38][page\\xa0needed][64][page\\xa0needed][65][page\\xa0needed]\\n\", 'Japanese confidence in their ability to win a short war meant that other targets in the harbor, especially the navy yard, oil tank farms and submarine base, were left unscathed, since by their thinking the war would be over before the influence of these facilities would be felt.[64][page\\xa0needed]\\n', 'Approach and attack', 'On November 26, 1941, a Japanese task force (the Striking Force) of six aircraft carriers\\xa0– Akagi, Kaga, Sōryū, Hiryū, Shōkaku, and Zuikaku\\xa0– departed Hittokapu Bay on Etorofu (now Iterup) Island in the Kuril Islands, en route to a position northwest of Hawaii, intending to launch its 408 aircraft to attack Pearl Harbor: 360 for the two attack waves and 48 on defensive combat air patrol (CAP), including nine fighters from the first wave.\\n', \"The first wave was to be the primary attack, while the second wave was to attack carriers as its first objective and cruisers as its second, with battleships as the third target.[66] The first wave carried most of the weapons designed to attack capital ships, mainly specially adapted Type 91 aerial torpedoes which were designed with an anti-roll mechanism and a rudder extension that let them operate in shallow water.[67] The aircrews were ordered to select the highest-value targets (battleships and aircraft carriers) or, if these were not present, any other high-value ships (cruisers and destroyers). First-wave dive bombers were to attack ground targets. Fighters were ordered to strafe and destroy as many parked aircraft as possible to ensure they did not intercept the bombers, especially in the first wave. When the fighters' fuel got low, they were to refuel aboard the aircraft carriers and return to combat. Fighters were to assume CAP duties where needed, especially over American airfields.[citation needed]\\n\", \"Before the attack commenced, the Imperial Japanese Navy launched reconnaissance floatplanes from heavy cruisers Chikuma and Tone, to scout Oahu and Lahaina Roads, Maui, respectively, with orders to report on American fleet composition and location.[68] Reconnaissance aircraft flights risked alerting the Americans,[69] and were not necessary. Fleet composition and preparedness information in Pearl Harbor were already known from the reports of the Japanese spy Takeo Yoshikawa. A report of the absence of the American fleet at Lahaina anchorage off Maui was received from the Tone's floatplane and the fleet submarine I-72.[70] Another four scout planes patrolled the area between the Japanese carrier force (the Kidō Butai) and Niihau, to detect any counterattack.[71]\\n\", 'Submarines', 'Fleet submarines I-16, I-18, I-20, I-22, and I-24 each embarked a Type A midget submarine for transport to the waters off Oahu.[72] The five I-boats left Kure Naval District on November 25, 1941.[72] On December 6, they came to within 10\\xa0nmi (19\\xa0km; 12\\xa0mi) of the mouth of Pearl Harbor[73] and launched their midget subs at about 01:00 local time on December 7.[74] At 03:42 Hawaiian time, the minesweeper Condor spotted a midget submarine periscope southwest of the Pearl Harbor entrance buoy and alerted the destroyer Ward.[75][76] The midget may have entered Pearl Harbor. However, Ward sank another midget submarine at 06:37[76][nb 12] in the first American shots in the Pacific Theater. A midget submarine on the north side of Ford Island missed the seaplane tender Curtiss with her first torpedo and missed the attacking destroyer Monaghan with her other one before being sunk by Monaghan at 08:43.[76]\\n', 'A third midget submarine, Ha-19, grounded twice, once outside the harbor entrance and again on the east side of Oahu, where it was captured on December 8.[78] Ensign Kazuo Sakamaki swam ashore and was captured by Hawaii National Guard Corporal David Akui, becoming the first Japanese prisoner of war.[nb 13][79] A fourth had been damaged by a depth charge attack and was abandoned by its crew before it could fire its torpedoes.[80] It was found outside the harbor in 1960. Japanese forces received a radio message from a midget submarine at 00:41 on December 8 claiming to have damaged one or more large warships inside Pearl Harbor.[81]\\n', 'In 1992, 2000, and 2001 Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory\\'s submersibles found the wreck of the fifth midget submarine lying in three parts outside Pearl Harbor. The wreck was in the debris field where much surplus American equipment had been dumped after the war, including vehicles and landing craft. Both of its torpedoes were missing. This correlates with reports of two torpedoes fired at the light cruiser St. Louis at 10:04 at the entrance of Pearl Harbor, and a possible torpedo fired at destroyer Helm at 08:21.[82] There is dispute over this official chain of events though. The \"torpedo\" that St. Louis saw was also reportedly a porpoising minesweeping float being towed by the destroyer Boggs.[83] A photo taken by a Japanese naval aviator of Battleship Row during the attack on Pearl Harbor was declassified in the 1990s and publicized in the 2000s to the public.[84] According to numerous historians and naval architects, this photo shows that the fifth midget submarine appeared to have fired a torpedo at West Virginia and another one at Oklahoma. These torpedoes were twice the size of the aerial torpedoes so it was possible that both torpedoes heavily contributed to the sinkings of both ships and especially helped to capsize Oklahoma because Oklahoma was the only battleship that day to suffer catastrophic damage to her belt armor at the waterline from a torpedo. Admiral Chester Nimitz, in a report to Congress, confirmed that one midget submarine\\'s torpedo (possibly from the other midget submarine that fired torpedoes but failed to hit a target) which was fired but did not explode was recovered in Pearl Harbor and was much larger than the aerial torpedoes.[85][86]\\n[87]\\n', 'Japanese declaration of war', 'The attack took place before any formal declaration of war was made by Japan, but this was not Admiral Yamamoto\\'s intention. He originally stipulated that the attack should not commence until thirty minutes after Japan had informed the United States that peace negotiations were at an end.[88] However, the attack began before the notice could be delivered. Tokyo transmitted the 5000-word notification (commonly called the \"14-Part Message\") in two blocks to the Japanese Embassy in Washington. Transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it at 1:00\\xa0p.m. Washington time, as ordered, and consequently the message was not presented until more than one hour after the attack had begun\\u200a—\\u200abut in fact, American code breakers had already deciphered and translated most of the message hours before it was scheduled to be delivered.[89][90]:\\u200app.2ff\\u200a The final part of the message is sometimes described as a declaration of war. While it was viewed by a number of senior American government and military officials as a very strong indicator negotiations were likely to be terminated[91] and that war might break out at any moment,[92] it neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations. A declaration of war was printed on the front page of Japan\\'s newspapers in the evening edition of December 8 (late December 7 in the United States),[93] but not delivered to the American government until the day after the attack.\\n', 'For decades, conventional wisdom held that Japan attacked without first formally breaking diplomatic relations only because of accidents and bumbling that delayed the delivery of a document hinting at war to Washington.[94] In 1999, however, Takeo Iguchi, a professor of law and international relations at International Christian University in Tokyo, discovered documents that pointed to a vigorous debate inside the government over how, and indeed whether, to notify Washington of Japan\\'s intention to break off negotiations and start a war, including a December 7 entry in the war diary saying, \"[O]ur deceptive diplomacy is steadily proceeding toward success.\" Of this, Iguchi said, \"The diary shows that the army and navy did not want to give any proper declaration of war, or indeed prior notice even of the termination of negotiations\\xa0... and they clearly prevailed.\"[95][96]\\n', 'In any event, even if the Japanese had decoded and delivered the 14-Part Message before the beginning of the attack, it would not have constituted either a formal break of diplomatic relations or a declaration of war.[97] The final two paragraphs of the message read:[98]\\n', ' Thus the earnest hope of the Japanese Government to adjust Japanese-American relations and to preserve and promote the peace of the Pacific through cooperation with the American Government has finally been lost.', 'The Japanese Government regrets to have to notify hereby the American Government that in view of the attitude of the American Government it cannot but consider that it is impossible to reach an agreement through further negotiations.', 'United States naval intelligence officers were alarmed by the unusual timing for delivering the message\\u200a—\\u200a1:00\\xa0p.m. on a Sunday, which was 7:30\\xa0a.m. in Hawaii\\u200a—\\u200aand attempted to alert Pearl Harbor. But due to communication problems the warning was not delivered before the attack.[90]:\\u200aCh. 1\\u200a\\n', 'First wave composition', 'The first attack wave of 183 airplanes, led by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida, was launched north of Oahu.[99] Six airplanes failed to launch due to technical difficulties.[71] The first wave included three groups of airplanes:[nb 14]\\n', \"As the first wave approached Oahu, it was detected by United States Army SCR-270 radar positioned at Opana Point near the island's northern tip. This post had been in training mode for months, but was not yet operational.[102] The operators, Privates George Elliot Jr. and Joseph Lockard, reported a target to Private Joseph P. McDonald, a private stationed at Fort Shafter's Intercept Center near Pearl Harbor.[103][104][105] Lieutenant Kermit A. Tyler, a newly assigned officer at the thinly manned Intercept Center, presumed it was the scheduled arrival of six B-17 bombers from California. The Japanese planes were approaching from a direction very close (only a few degrees difference) to the bombers,[106] and while the operators had never seen a formation as large on radar, they neglected to tell Tyler of its size.[107] Tyler, for security reasons, could not tell the operators of the six B-17s that were due (even though it was widely known).[107]\\n\", \"As the first wave approached Oahu, they encountered and shot down several American aircraft. At least one of these radioed a somewhat incoherent warning. Other warnings from ships off the harbor entrance were still being processed or awaiting confirmation when the Japanese air assault began at 7:48\\xa0a.m. Hawaiian time[108] (3:18\\xa0a.m. December 8 Japanese Standard Time, as kept by ships of the Kido Butai),[109] with the attack on Kaneohe. A total of 353[18] Japanese planes reached Oahu in two waves. Slow, vulnerable torpedo bombers led the first wave, exploiting the first moments of surprise to attack the most important ships present (the battleships), while dive bombers attacked American air bases across Oahu, starting with Hickam Field, the largest, and Wheeler Field, the main United States Army Air Forces fighter base. The 171 planes in the second wave attacked the Army Air Forces' Bellows Field, near Kaneohe on the windward side of the island, and Ford Island. The only aerial opposition came from a handful of P-36 Hawks, P-40 Warhawks and some SBD Dauntless dive bombers from the carrier Enterprise.[citation needed][nb 15]\\n\", 'In the first-wave attack, about eight of the forty-nine 800‑kg (1760\\xa0lb) armor-piercing bombs dropped hit their intended battleship targets. At least two of those bombs broke up on impact, another detonated before penetrating an unarmored deck, and one was a dud. Thirteen of the forty torpedoes hit battleships, while four hit other ships.[111] Men aboard the ships awoke to the sounds of alarms, bombs exploding, and gunfire, prompting them to dress as they ran to General Quarters stations. (The famous message, \"Air raid Pearl Harbor. This is not drill.\",[nb 16] was sent from the headquarters of Patrol Wing Two, the first senior Hawaiian command to respond.) American servicemen were caught unprepared by the attack. Ammunition lockers were locked, aircraft parked wingtip to wingtip in the open to prevent sabotage,[112] guns unmanned (none of the Navy\\'s 5\"/38s, only a quarter of its machine guns, and only four of 31 Army batteries got in action).[112] Despite this low alert status, many American military personnel responded effectively during the attack.[nb 17] Ensign Joseph Taussig Jr., aboard Nevada, commanded the ship\\'s antiaircraft guns and was severely wounded but remained at his post. Lieutenant Commander F. J. Thomas commanded Nevada in the captain\\'s absence and got her underway until the ship was grounded at 9:10\\xa0a.m.[114] One of the destroyers, Aylwin, got underway with only four officers aboard, all ensigns, none with more than a year\\'s sea duty; she operated at sea for 36 hours before her commanding officer managed to get back aboard.[115] Captain Mervyn Bennion, commanding West Virginia, led his men until he was cut down by fragments from a bomb which hit Tennessee, moored alongside.[116]\\n', 'Second wave composition', 'The second planned wave consisted of 171 planes: 54 B5Ns, 81 D3As, and 36 A6Ms, commanded by Lieutenant-Commander Shigekazu Shimazaki.[100] Four planes failed to launch because of technical difficulties.[71] This wave and its targets also comprised three groups of planes:[100]\\n', 'The second wave was divided into three groups. One was tasked to attack Kāneʻohe, the rest Pearl Harbor proper. The separate sections arrived at the attack point almost simultaneously from several directions.\\n', 'American casualties and damage', 'Ninety minutes after it began, the attack was over. 2,008 sailors were killed and 710 others wounded; 218 soldiers and airmen (who were part of the Army prior to the independent United States Air Force in 1947) were killed and 364 wounded; 109 Marines were killed and 69 wounded; and 68 civilians were killed and 35 wounded. In total, 2,403 Americans were killed, and 1,178 were wounded.[117][118] Eighteen ships were sunk or run aground, including five battleships.[12][119] All of the Americans killed or wounded during the attack were legally non-combatants, given that there was no state of war when the attack occurred.[120][121]\\n', 'Of the American fatalities, nearly half were due to the explosion of Arizona\\'s forward magazine after she was hit by a modified 16-inch (410\\xa0mm) shell.[nb 18] Author Craig Nelson wrote that the vast majority of the U.S. sailors killed at Pearl Harbor were junior enlisted personnel. \"The officers of the Navy all lived in houses and the junior people were the ones on the boats, so pretty much all of the people who died in the direct line of the attack were very junior people\", Nelson said. \"So everyone is about 17 or 18 whose story is told there.\"[122]\\n', 'Among the notable civilian casualties were nine Honolulu Fire Department firefighters who responded to Hickam Field during the bombing in Honolulu, becoming the only fire department members on American soil to be attacked by a foreign power in history. Fireman Harry Tuck Lee Pang of Engine\\xa06 was killed near the hangars by machine-gun fire from a Japanese plane. Captains Thomas Macy and John Carreira of Engine\\xa04 and Engine\\xa01, respectively, died while battling flames inside the hangar after a Japanese bomb crashed through the roof. An additional six firefighters were wounded by Japanese shrapnel. The wounded later received Purple Hearts (originally reserved for service members wounded by enemy action while partaking in armed conflicts) for their peacetime actions that day on June 13, 1944; the three firefighters killed did not receive theirs until December 7, 1984, on the 43rd anniversary of the attack. This made the nine men the only non-military firefighters to receive such an award in American history.[123]\\n', 'Already damaged by a torpedo and on fire amidships, Nevada attempted to exit the harbor. She was targeted by many Japanese bombers as she got under way and sustained more hits from 250\\xa0lb (113\\xa0kg) bombs, which started further fires. She was deliberately beached to avoid risking blocking the harbor entrance if she sank there. California was hit by two bombs and two torpedoes. The crew might have kept her afloat, but were ordered to abandon ship just as they were raising power for the pumps. Burning oil from Arizona and West Virginia was drifted down toward her and probably made the situation look worse than it was. The disarmed target ship Utah was holed twice by torpedoes. West Virginia was hit by seven torpedoes, the seventh tearing away her rudder. Oklahoma was hit by four torpedoes, the last two above her belt armor, which caused her to capsize. Maryland was hit by two of the converted 16\" shells, but neither caused serious damage.\\n', 'Although the Japanese concentrated on battleships (the largest vessels present), they did not ignore other targets. The light cruiser Helena was torpedoed, and the concussion from the blast capsized the neighboring minelayer Oglala. Two destroyers in dry dock, Cassin and Downes, were destroyed when bombs penetrated their fuel bunkers. The leaking fuel caught fire; flooding the dry dock in an effort to fight fire made the burning oil rise, and both were burned out. Cassin slipped from her keel blocks and rolled against Downes. The light cruiser Raleigh was holed by a torpedo. The light cruiser Honolulu was damaged but remained in service. The repair vessel Vestal, moored alongside Arizona, was heavily damaged and beached. The seaplane tender Curtiss was also damaged. The destroyer Shaw was badly damaged when two bombs penetrated her forward magazine.[124]\\n', 'Of the 402 American aircraft in Hawaii, 188 were destroyed and 159 damaged, 155 of them on the ground.[18] Almost none were actually ready to take off to defend the base. Eight Army Air Forces pilots managed to get airborne during the attack,[125] and six were credited with downing at least one Japanese aircraft during the attack: 1st Lieutenant Lewis M. Sanders and 2nd Lieutenants Philip M. Rasmussen, Kenneth M. Taylor, George S. Welch, Harry W. Brown, and Gordon H. Sterling Jr.[126][127] Of 33 Consolidated PBY Catalinas in Hawaii, 30 were destroyed, while three on patrol at the time of the attack returned undamaged. Friendly fire brought down some American planes on top of that, including four from an inbound flight from Enterprise.[128]\\n', 'At the time of the attack, nine civilian aircraft were flying in the vicinity of Pearl Harbor. Of these, three were shot down.[129]\\n', 'Japanese losses', \"Fifty-five Japanese airmen and nine submariners were killed in the attack, and one, Kazuo Sakamaki, was captured. Of Japan's 414[100] available planes, 350 took part in the raid. Twenty-nine were lost, nine in the first wave (three fighters, one dive bomber, and five torpedo bombers) and twenty in the second (six fighters and fourteen dive bombers),[130][nb 19] with another 74 damaged by antiaircraft fire from the ground.[citation needed]\\n\", 'Possible third wave', \"According to some accounts, several Japanese junior officers, including Fuchida and Genda, urged Nagumo to carry out a third strike in order to sink more of the Pearl Harbor's remaining warships, and damage the base's maintenance shops, drydock facilities and oil tank yards.[49] Most notably, Fuchida gave a firsthand account of this meeting several times after the war. However, some historians have cast doubt on this and many other of Fuchida's later claims, which sometimes conflict with documented historic records.[131] Genda, who opined during the planning for the attack that without an invasion three strikes were necessary to fully disable the Pacific Fleet,[132] denied requesting an additional attack.[133] Regardless, it is undisputed that the captains of the other five carriers in the task force reported they were willing and ready to carry out a third strike soon after the second returned,[134] but Nagumo decided to withdraw for several reasons:\\n\", 'Although a hypothetical third strike would have likely focused on the base\\'s remaining warships,[141] military historians have suggested any potential damage to the shore facilities would have hampered the Pacific Fleet far more seriously.[64][page\\xa0needed][65][page\\xa0needed] If they had been wiped out, \"serious [American] operations in the Pacific would have been postponed for more than a year\";[142] according to Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, later Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet, \"it would have prolonged the war another two years\".[143]\\n', \"At a conference aboard his flagship the following morning, Yamamoto supported Nagumo's withdrawal without launching a third wave.[139] In retrospect, sparing the vital dockyards, maintenance shops, and the oil tank farm meant the United States could respond relatively quickly in the Pacific. Yamamoto later regretted Nagumo's decision to withdraw and categorically stated it had been a great mistake not to order a third strike.[144]\\n\", 'Ships lost or damaged', 'Twenty-one American ships were damaged or lost in the attack, of which all but three were repaired and returned to service.[145]\\n', 'Battleships', 'Ex-battleship (target/AA training ship)', 'Cruisers', 'Destroyers', 'Auxiliaries', 'Salvage', 'After a systematic search for survivors, Captain Homer N. Wallin was ordered to lead a formal salvage operation.[150][nb 20]\\n', 'Around Pearl Harbor, divers from the Navy (shore and tenders), the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, and civilian contractors (Pacific Bridge Company and others) began work on the ships that could be refloated. They patched holes, cleared debris, and pumped water out of ships. Melvin Storer and other Navy divers worked inside the damaged ships.[152] Within six months, five battleships and two cruisers were patched or refloated so they could be sent to shipyards in Pearl Harbor and on the mainland for extensive repair.[153]\\n', \"Intensive salvage operations continued for another year, a total of some 20,000 man-hours under water.[154][page\\xa0needed][155] Arizona and the target ship Utah were too heavily damaged for salvage and remain where they were sunk,[156] with Arizona becoming a war memorial. Oklahoma, while successfully raised, was never repaired and capsized while under tow to the mainland in 1947. The Nevada proved particularly difficult to raise and repair; two men involved in the operation died after inhaling poisonous gases that had accumulated in the ship's interior.[153] When feasible, armament and equipment were removed from vessels too damaged to repair and put to use to improve the anti-aircraft defense of the harbor or installed aboard other craft.[157]\\n\", 'News coverage', 'Coverage in the United States', 'The initial announcement of the attack on Pearl Harbor was made by the White House Press Secretary, Stephen Early, at 2:22\\xa0p.m. Eastern time (8:52\\xa0a.m. Hawaiian time): \"The Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor from the air and all naval and military activities on the island of Oahu, principal American base in the Hawaiian islands.\"[158] As information developed, Early made a number of additional announcements to approximately 150 White House reporters over the course of the afternoon.[159]\\n', 'Initial reports of the attack moved on news wires at approximately 2:25\\xa0p.m. Eastern time. The first radio coverage (which, at the time, represented the earliest opportunity for ordinary people to learn of the attack) was on the CBS radio network\\'s scheduled news program, World News Today, at 2:30\\xa0p.m. Eastern time. John Charles Daly read the initial report, then switched to London, where Robert Trout ad-libbed on the possible London reaction. The first report on NBC cut into a play, a dramatization of The Inspector-General, at 2:33\\xa0p.m. Eastern time and lasted only 21 seconds. Unlike the later practice with major news stories, there were only brief interruptions of scheduled commercial programming.[160] The attacks were covered on television but the extent of it was limited; as commercial television had started just 6 months earlier, \"a few thousand TV sets existed\" in the United States, with most being in the Greater New York City area, and only a handful of stations existed which were all in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. WNBT from New York was the only TV station that was regularly airing that day in the country, with the comedy movie Millionaire Playboy, which was scheduled for 3:30-4:30 PM, being interrupted with the news of the attack. The other station known to cover the attacks was WCBW, also out of New York, where a special report on the attack was broadcast that evening. There are no recordings of either stations\\' coverage, either visual or audio.[161]\\n', 'A contemporaneous newspaper report compared the attack to the Battle of Port Arthur in which the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the Imperial Russian Navy, triggering the Russo-Japanese War, 37 years prior.[162] Modern writers have continued to note parallels between the attacks, albeit more dispassionately.[163]\\n', 'Coverage in Japan', 'News of the attack was first broadcast at 11:30 AM (Japanese Standard Time), however it had already been announced \"shortly after\" 7 AM (Japanese Standard Time) that Japan had \"entered into a situation of war with the United States and Britain in the Western Pacific before dawn.\" There was no further elaboration or explanation, and the attacks were already finished by that time.[164] The attack on Pearl Harbor was eventually covered in the Japanese press, but press in wartime Japan was heavily censored.[165] One Japanese newspaper, The Asahi Shimbun did report on the attack the day it occurred, and from that point onward their editorials began to back governmental decisions regardless of what they were.[166] The Asahi Shimbun also reported the declaration of war on the United States after the attacks, framing it as an Imperial Order, with most Japanese people taking it that way. In contrast, coverage in the New York Times focused on \"the danger to democracy and to the nation\" brought on by the Japanese attack.[165] NHK broadcast 12 special news reports along with its 6 regularly scheduled ones that day.[164]\\n', 'Aftermath', 'The day after the attack, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his famous Day of Infamy speech to a Joint Session of Congress, calling for a formal declaration of war on the Empire of Japan. Congress obliged his request less than an hour later. On December 11, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, even though the Tripartite Pact did not require it.[nb 21] Congress issued a declaration of war against Germany and Italy later that same day.\\n', 'The United Kingdom had already been at war with Germany since September 1939 and with Italy since June 1940, and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had promised to declare war \"within the hour\" of a Japanese attack on the United States.[170] Upon learning of the Japanese attacks on Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, Churchill promptly determined there was no need to either wait or further consult the US government and immediately summoned the Japanese Ambassador. As a result, the United Kingdom declared war on Japan nine hours before the United States did.\\n', 'The attack was an initial shock to all the Allies in the Pacific Theater. Further losses compounded the alarming setback. Japan attacked the Philippines hours later (because of the time difference, it was December 8 in the Philippines). Only three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the battleship Prince of Wales and battlecruiser Repulse were sunk off the coast of Malaya, causing Churchill later to recollect \"In all the war I never received a more direct shock. As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me. There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California. Over this vast expanse of waters, Japan was supreme and we everywhere were weak and naked.\"[171]\\n', 'Throughout the war, Pearl Harbor was frequently used in American propaganda.[172]\\n', 'One further consequence of the attack on Pearl Harbor and its aftermath (notably the Niihau incident) was that Japanese-American residents and citizens were relocated to nearby Japanese-American internment camps. Within hours of the attack, hundreds of Japanese-American leaders were rounded up and taken to high-security camps such as Sand Island at the mouth of Honolulu harbor and Kilauea Military Camp on the island of Hawaii.[173][page\\xa0needed][174] Eventually, more than 110,000 Japanese Americans, nearly all who lived on the West Coast, were forced into interior camps, but in Hawaii, where the 150,000-plus Japanese Americans composed over one-third of the population, only 1,200 to 1,800 were interned.[175][page\\xa0needed][176][177]\\n', 'The attack also had international consequences. The Canadian province of British Columbia, bordering the Pacific Ocean, had long had a large population of Japanese immigrants and their Japanese-Canadian descendants. Pre-war tensions were exacerbated by the Pearl Harbor attack, leading to a reaction from the government of Canada. On February 24, 1942, Order-in-Council P.C. no. 1486 was passed under the War Measures Act, allowing for the forced removal of any and all Canadians of Japanese descent from British Columbia, as well as prohibiting them from returning to the province. On March 4, regulations under the act were adopted to evacuate Japanese Canadians.[178] As a result, 12,000 were interned in interior camps, 2,000 were sent to road camps, and another 2,000 were forced to work in the prairies on sugar beet farms.[179]\\n', 'In the wake of the attack, 15 Medals of Honor, 51 Navy Crosses, 53 Silver Stars, four Navy and Marine Corps Medals, one Distinguished Flying Cross, four Distinguished Service Crosses, one Distinguished Service Medal, and three Bronze Star Medals were awarded to the American servicemen who distinguished themselves in combat at Pearl Harbor.[180] Additionally, a special military award, the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Medal, was later authorized for all military veterans of the attack.\\n', 'Niihau Incident', 'Japanese planners of the Pearl Harbor attack had determined that some means were required for rescuing fliers whose aircraft were damaged too badly to return to the carriers. The island of Niihau, only thirty minutes by air from Pearl Harbor, was designated as the rescue point.[citation needed]\\n', \"During the second wave, a Zero fighter flown by Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi of Hiryu was damaged in the attack on Wheeler, so he flew to the rescue point. The aircraft was further damaged on his crash landing. Nishikaichi was helped from the wreckage by one of the Native Hawaiians, who, aware of the tension between the United States and Japan, took the pilot's pistol, maps, codes and other documents. The island's residents had no telephones or radios and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Nishikaichi enlisted the support of three Japanese-American residents in an attempt to recover the documents. During the ensuing struggles, Nishikaichi was killed, and a Hawaiian civilian was wounded; one collaborator committed suicide, and his wife and the third collaborator were sent to prison.[citation needed]\\n\", \"The ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents had apparently gone to Nishikaichi's assistance was a source of concern for many and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted.[181]\\n\", 'Strategic implications', 'Rear Admiral Chūichi Hara summed up the Japanese result by saying, \"We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war.\"[182]\\n', 'While the attack accomplished its intended objective, it turned out to be largely unnecessary. Unbeknownst to Yamamoto, who conceived the original plan, the United States Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon \"charging\" across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war (in keeping with the evolution of Plan Orange).[38][page\\xa0needed] The United States instead adopted \"Plan Dog\" in 1940, which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia, while the United States concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany.[183][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed]\\n', 'Fortunately for the United States, the American aircraft carriers were untouched; otherwise the Pacific Fleet\\'s ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or more (given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet). As it was, the Navy was left with no choice but to rely on carriers and submarines. While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service, their relatively low speed and high fuel consumption limited their deployment, and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles (their only major action being the Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944). A major flaw in Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan. As a result, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded battleships for a \"decisive battle\" that never happened.[64][page\\xa0needed][184][page\\xa0needed]\\n', 'The Japanese confidence in their ability to win a quick victory meant that they neglected Pearl Harbor\\'s navy repair yards, oil tank farms, submarine base and old headquarters building.[64][page\\xa0needed] All of these targets were omitted from Genda\\'s list, yet they proved more important than any battleship to the American war effort in the Pacific. The survival of the repair shops and fuel depots allowed Pearl Harbor to maintain logistical support of the Navy,[185][186] such as the Doolittle Raid and the Battles of the Coral Sea and Midway. It was submarines that immobilized the Imperial Japanese Navy\\'s heavy ships and brought Japan\\'s economy to a virtual standstill by crippling the importation of oil and raw materials: by the end of 1942, the amount of raw materials brought in was cut in half, \"to a disastrous ten million tons\", while oil \"was almost completely stopped\".[nb 22] Lastly, the basement of the Old Administration Building was the home of the cryptanalytic unit which contributed significantly to the Midway ambush and the Submarine Force\\'s success.[187]\\n', 'Retrospective debate on American intelligence', 'Ever since the Japanese attack, there has been debate as to how and why the United States had been caught unaware, and how much and when American officials knew of Japanese plans and related topics. As early as 1924, Chief of United States Air Service Mason Patrick showed concern for military vulnerabilities in the Pacific, having sent General Billy Mitchell on a survey of the Pacific and the East. Patrick called Mitchell\\'s subsequent report, which identified vulnerabilities in Hawaii, a \"theoretical treatise on employment of airpower in the Pacific, which, in all probability undoubtedly will be of extreme value some 10 or 15 years hence\".[188]\\n', 'At least two naval war games, one in 1932 and another in 1936, proved that Pearl was vulnerable to such an attack. Admiral James Richardson was removed from command shortly after protesting President Roosevelt\\'s decision to move the bulk of the Pacific fleet to Pearl Harbor.[189][page\\xa0needed][190] The decisions of military and political leadership to ignore these warnings have contributed to conspiracy theories. Several writers, including decorated World War\\xa0II veteran and journalist Robert Stinnett, author of Day of Deceit, and former United States Rear Admiral Robert Alfred Theobald, author of The Final Secret of Pearl Harbor: The Washington Background of the Pearl Harbor Attack, have argued that various parties high in the American and British governments knew of the attack in advance and may even have let it happen or encouraged it in order to force the United States into the war via the so-called \"back door\". However, this conspiracy theory is rejected by mainstream historians.[191][page\\xa0needed][192][193][page\\xa0needed][194][nb 23]\\n', 'The theory that the Americans were warned in advance, however, is supported by statements made by Dick Ellis, a British-Australian intelligence officer for MI6 who helped William J. Donovan set up the Office of Strategic Services. Ellis was deputy to William Stephenson at British Security Co-ordination. In Jesse Fink\\'s 2023 biography of Ellis, The Eagle in the Mirror, Ellis is quoted as saying: \"[Stephenson] was convinced from the information that was reaching him that this attack was imminent, and through Jimmy Roosevelt, President Roosevelt\\'s son, he passed this information to the President.

Originally, it was awarded only to players from Europe and was widely known as the European Footballer of the Year award. In 1995, the Ballon d'Or was expanded to include all players of any origin that have been active at European clubs. The award became a global prize in 2007 with all professional footballers from around the world being eligible; additionally, coaches and captains of national teams were also given the right to vote, before reverting to just journalists in 2016.\\n\", \"Between 2010 and 2015, in an agreement with FIFA, the award was temporarily merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year, and was known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or. That partnership ended in 2016, and the award reverted to the Ballon d'Or, while FIFA also reverted to its own separate annual award, The Best FIFA Men's Player. In 2022, France Football modified the rules for the Ballon d'Or. The timing was changed so that awards were given not for achievements during a calendar year, but for a football season, and it was also determined that only a single journalist from each country in the top 100 of the FIFA Men's World Ranking would be allowed to vote. UEFA co-organizes the Ballon d'Or gala since 2024, with France Football retaining the voting system and the Ballon d'Or name.\\n\", \"Lionel Messi won the award a record eight times, and he is also the current holder of the Ballon d'Or, having won its most recent edition in 2023. Cristiano Ronaldo won it five times and amassed a record eighteen nominations in his career. Michel Platini, Johan Cruyff and Marco van Basten each won the award three times, while Franz Beckenbauer, Ronaldo, Alfredo Di Stéfano, Kevin Keegan and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge have each won it twice.\\n\", 'Overview', 'The Ballon d\\'Or is widely regarded as football\\'s most prestigious and valuable individual award.[1][2][3][4] Nevertheless, critics have occasionally described the award as a \"popularity contest\",[5][6] criticizing its voting process,[7] its bias in favour of attacking players,[8] and the idea of systematically singling out an individual in a team sport.[9][10]\\n', \"Stanley Matthews of England was the inaugural winner of the Ballon d'Or.[11][12] Prior to 2007, the award was based exclusively on voting by football journalists and was generally known as the continental European Footballer of the Year award in English language and much international media.[13][14] Even after 2007, it was usually identified with and referred to by that name because of its origin as a European award,[15][16] until it was merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year award cementing its new worldwide claim.[17][18] Liberia's George Weah, the only African recipient, became the first non-European to win the award in 1995, the year that rules of eligibility were changed and the Ballon d'Or was expanded to include all players of any origin, active at European clubs;[19][20] two years later, Ronaldo of Brazil became the first South American to claim the award,[19] and he is still the youngest winner ever at 21 years and 96 days old.[21] The award became a global prize in 2007 with all professional footballers from clubs around the world being eligible;[22] additionally, coaches and captains of national teams were also given the right to vote,[14][21] before reverting to just journalists in 2016.[7]\\n\", \"Lionel Messi won the Ballon d'Or a record eight times,[4][23] while five-time winner Cristiano Ronaldo earned the most nominations with eighteen.[24] Messi is the only player to win the award with three different teams and also the only one to win it while playing outside Europe,[25] as well as being the player with the most podiums, finishing in the top-three a record fourteen times.[4] Three players have won the award three times each: Michel Platini, Johan Cruyff and Marco van Basten.[11][24] With seven awards each, Dutch, German, Portuguese and French players have won the second most Ballons d'Or, underneath Argentina in first with eight.[20] Players from Germany (1972, 1981) and the Netherlands (1988) occupied the top-three spots in a single year. German (1972) and Italian (1988–1990) clubs achieved the same feat, including two individual years dominated by Milan players (1988, 1989), a unique record until Spanish clubs experienced an unprecedented dominance (2009–2012, 2015, 2016) and Barcelona (2010) became the second club to occupy the top-three.[23] The award shows a bias in favour of attacking players,[8] and, over time, it has gone to a more exclusive set of leagues and clubs.[14] Prior to 1995, ten leagues supplied Ballon d'Or winners, whereas only England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United States have supplied winners since then.[14][26] Spain's La Liga has the most Ballon d'Or winners overall, with twenty-four wins shared between Barcelona and Real Madrid; with twelve wins each, the two Spanish clubs also lead the overall club ranking for producing the most winners.[26][27]\\n\", \"Between 2010 and 2015 inclusive, the award was merged with a similar one, the FIFA World Player of the Year award, to create the FIFA Ballon d'Or,[28] which was awarded to the world's best male player before FIFA and France Football decided not to continue the merging agreement.[2][21] The recipients of the joint FIFA Ballon d'Or are considered as winners by both award organizations.[14][29][30] After 2011, UEFA created the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award to maintain the tradition of the original Ballon d'Or of specifically honouring a football player from Europe.[31] In 2020, Groupe Amaury, to which France Football belongs,[32] decided that no award would be given for the year due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on association football.[1][33] The widespread public opinion is that the 2020 Ballon d'Or should have been awarded to Robert Lewandowski.[34][35][36]\\n\", \"France Football modified the rules for the Ballon d'Or in 2022. They changed the timing so that awards were given not for achievements during a calendar year, but for a football season.[21][37] It was also decided that only a single journalist from each country in the top 100 of the FIFA Men's World Ranking would be allowed to vote.[7] The plebiscite had previously been open to all countries since 2007.[21][37] This brought the Ballon d'Or into line with the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award which was slightly less dominated by exclusive leagues and, in particular, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in the 2010s.[37] UEFA co-organizes the Ballon d'Or gala since 2024, with France Football retaining the voting system and the Ballon d'Or name.[32][38]\\n\", 'Winners', \"Note: Until 2021, the Ballon d'Or was awarded based on player performance during the calendar year.

      "['From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia', 'Contents', 'Liz Truss', '\\n', '\\n', 'Mary Elizabeth Truss (born 26 July 1975) is a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party from September to October 2022. On her fiftieth day in office, she stepped down amid a government crisis, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. The member of Parliament (MP) for South West Norfolk since 2010, Truss previously held various Cabinet positions under three prime ministers—David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson—lastly as foreign secretary from 2021 to 2022. \\n', 'Truss studied philosophy, politics and economics at Merton College, Oxford, and was the president of the Oxford University Liberal Democrats. In 1996 she joined the Conservative Party. She worked at Royal Dutch Shell and Cable & Wireless and was the deputy director of the think tank Reform. After two unsuccessful attempts to be elected to the House of Commons, she became the MP for South West Norfolk at the 2010 general election. As a backbencher she called for reform in several policy areas including the economy, childcare and mathematics in education. Truss co-founded the Free Enterprise Group of Conservative MPs and wrote or co-wrote a number of papers and books, including After the Coalition and Britannia Unchained.\\n', \"Truss was the parliamentary under-secretary of state for childcare and education from 2012 to 2014 before Cameron appointed her secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs in a cabinet reshuffle. Although she campaigned for the UK to remain in the European Union, Truss supported Brexit following the outcome of the 2016 referendum. Following Cameron's resignation in 2016, his successor Theresa May appointed her secretary of state for justice and lord chancellor, making Truss the first woman to serve as lord chancellor in the office's thousand-year history; in the aftermath of the 2017 general election, she was demoted to chief secretary to the Treasury. After May announced her resignation in May 2019, Truss supported Johnson's successful bid to become Conservative leader and prime minister. He appointed Truss secretary of state for international trade and president of the Board of Trade in July and subsequently to the additional role of minister for women and equalities in September. Johnson promoted Truss to foreign secretary in the 2021 cabinet reshuffle; during her time in the position, she led negotiations on the Northern Ireland Protocol and the UK's response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\\n\", \"In September 2022 Truss defeated Rishi Sunak in a leadership election to succeed Johnson, who had resigned because of an earlier government crisis, and was appointed as prime minister by Elizabeth II two days before the monarch's death; her government's business was subsequently suspended during a national mourning period of ten days. In response to the rising cost of living and increased energy prices, her ministry announced the Energy Price Guarantee. The government then announced large-scale tax cuts and borrowing, which led to financial instability and were largely reversed. Facing mounting criticism and loss of confidence in her leadership, Truss announced her resignation as leader of the Conservative Party on 20 October. Sunak was elected unopposed as her successor, and appointed prime minister on 25 October.\\n\", 'Early life and education (1975–1996)', 'Mary Elizabeth Truss was born on 26 July 1975 at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England.[1] She was the second child of John and Priscilla Truss (née\\xa0Grasby); the year before Truss\\'s birth, their first son, Matthew, had died.[1][n 2] Truss was known by her middle name, Elizabeth, from early childhood, with her father—a professor of pure mathematics at the University of Leeds—using it regularly, which she preferred;[3] after being given a badge with \"Mary\" on it on her first day of school, Truss asked her teacher that it be changed.[4] She later described her parents\\' politics as being \"to the left of Labour\";[5] her mother, a teacher and nurse, was a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.[6] When Truss stood for election as a Conservative, her mother agreed to campaign with her but her father declined to do so.[7] Her parents divorced in 2003.[8]\\n', '[S]he stands out in my memory as a sort of strange, unfocused force, hugely in favour of action and change\\xa0... it was always hard to see the aim of it all, or where it might lead, except that she would be at the centre of it.\\n', 'Julian Glover on Truss, his former schoolmate.[9]', 'In 1977 Truss and her parents moved to Warsaw, but returned to Britain after John and Priscilla found it \"quite grim\".[10] After living briefly in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, the family moved to Paisley in Scotland when Truss was four years old, where she attended West Primary School.[11] In 1985 they moved south to Leeds, where Truss attended Roundhay School; she later said in 2022 that at the school she \"saw kids\\xa0... being let down\", a claim which was criticised as inaccurate by several former Roundhay pupils.[12] When Truss was 12 she and her family spent a year in Burnaby, British Columbia, where she attended Parkcrest Elementary School whilst her father taught at Simon Fraser University.[13] Truss praised the Canadian curriculum and the attitude that it was \"really good to be top of the class\", which she contrasted with her education at Roundhay.[14]\\n', 'Truss\\'s parents had initially wanted her to study at the University of Cambridge, but Truss instead elected to go to Oxford in what her biographers, Cole and Heale, call a \"bout of teenage rebellion\".[15] She applied to Merton College but was instead pooled to the all-women\\'s St Hilda\\'s College; annoyed, she then complained to both colleges, after which she was accepted by Merton and began her studies there in September 1993.[16] Truss read philosophy, politics and economics and graduated in 1996.[17] During her time at university, Truss was active in the Liberal Democrats and was a member of the Oxford Reform Club.[18] She became the president of the Oxford University Liberal Democrats in her first year[19] and a member of the national executive committee of Liberal Democrat Youth and Students (LDYS) in 1995.[20] During Truss\\'s previous, unsuccessful bid for the LDYS executive, the party\\'s leader, Paddy Ashdown, said she was \"a good debater and is utterly fearless\".[20] As a Liberal Democrat, Truss supported the abolition of the monarchy and the legalisation of cannabis,[21] and campaigned against the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.[22] However, by November 1995 Truss had become critical of the Liberal Democrats, as she \"realised the Tory Party was saying quite sane things\"; in her last year at the university, she resigned from the LDYS.[23] By 1996 Truss had joined the Conservative Party.[24]\\n', 'Career', 'Employment and candidatures (1996–2010)', 'From 1996 to 2000 Truss worked for Royal Dutch Shell, living in Lewisham and Greenwich and qualifying as a chartered management accountant.[25][26] In 2000 she was employed by Cable & Wireless and rose to the position of economic director before leaving in 2005;[27] one of her colleagues there, the Labour peer George Robertson, said that Truss \"had a passion for politics\\xa0... she [was] fresh minded, enthusiastic and the Tory Party needed people like that\".[28] In January 2008, after losing her first two elections, Truss became the deputy director of Reform, a centre-right think tank, where she advocated for more focus on countering serious and organised crime and higher standards in schools and action to tackle what Reform perceived as Britain\\'s \"falling competitiveness\".[29] She co-authored The Value of Mathematics,[30] Fit for Purpose,[31] A New Level,[30] Back To Black[32][33] and other reports.[30]\\n', 'Whilst working at Shell, Truss served as the chair of the Lewisham Deptford Conservative Association from 1998 to 2000, having been introduced to the branch by her friend and later Conservative MP Jackie Doyle-Price.[24][34] During this time, at a reception at the Greenwich Conservative Association, Truss met her future husband, Hugh O\\'Leary,[24] whom she married in 2000 and with whom she has two daughters: Frances (born 2006) and Liberty (born 2008).[35][36] Truss unsuccessfully stood for election twice in Greenwich London Borough Council: for Vanbrugh ward in 1998 and Blackheath Westcombe in 2002.[37][38] The deputy leader of Greenwich Conservatives, Graeme Coombes, recalled in 2022 that Truss \"said [in 1998] she was hoping to stand for Parliament\\xa0... she was destined for bigger and better things\".[39] However, Alex Grant, the candidate who had defeated Truss in 2002, called her \"largely invisible during the campaign\".[40] In the 2006 council election, Truss was elected for Eltham South,[41] but did not seek re-election to the council in 2010, standing down the day she became an MP.[42]\\n', \"At the 2001 general election Truss was selected for the safe Labour seat of Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, coming a distant second but achieving a 3.2 per cent swing to the Conservatives, thought impressive by her party colleagues.[7][44] The election saw the Conservatives make a net gain of one seat, which was considered a disappointment;[45] the party leader William Hague subsequently resigned, with Truss supporting the former defence secretary Michael Portillo's unsuccessful leadership campaign.[46]\\n\", 'In January 2005 Sue Catling, the parliamentary candidate for the Calder Valley constituency, was forced to resign by the local Conservative Association because of an affair with the association\\'s chairman.[47] Catling claimed that the members of the party that had opposed her were sexist and said that she was \"accused of everything except murder and paedophilia\".[48] Truss, who was selected as the candidate for the seat, narrowly lost to the Labour incumbent after an active Conservative campaign which The Yorkshire Post described as \"Blitzkrieg\".[49] Beginning in 2004, Truss embarked on an 18-month affair with the Conservative MP Mark Field, which ended shortly after the following year\\'s election.[50]\\n', 'Following the 2005 general election David Cameron replaced Michael Howard as leader, and Truss was added to the party\\'s A-List, a list of potential Conservative candidates;[44] in October 2009 she was selected for the constituency of South West Norfolk by members of the local Conservative Association, winning over 50 per cent of the vote in the first round of the final against 5 other candidates, including the future deputy prime minister Thérèse Coffey.[51][52] Shortly after her selection, some members of the constituency association objected to Truss\\'s selection because of her failure to declare her affair with Field.[53] The Mail on Sunday was the first to report on the affair, and party members claimed to have been misled over Truss\\'s \"skeleton in the cupboard\".[52] A motion was proposed to terminate Truss\\'s candidature; the proponents of Truss\\'s deselection were branded the \"Turnip Taliban\" by Conservative Party officials and the press, including by the Mail,[54] a reference to stereotypes about Norfolk being a county of farmers.[55] There was also controversy over the fact that Truss was not from Norfolk, with some in the association asking for a local candidate and saying that she had been \"parachuted in\".[56] On 16 November, the motion was put to the association: following both sides making their arguments, including what Cole and Heale call an \"impassioned\" speech from Truss, it was defeated by 132 votes to 37.[57][58]\\n', 'Backbencher (2010–2012)', 'Truss was elected as an MP in the 2010 general election, which saw 148 other Conservatives become MPs for the first time;[59] many of what The Independent described as the \"golden generation\" would later reach high ranks in government.[60] The Conservatives did not reach an overall majority in the House of Commons and entered into a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, with Cameron becoming prime minister.[61] Following her election to Parliament, Truss campaigned for issues relating to her constituency, including the retention of the Tornado GR4 airbase at RAF Marham in her constituency;[62][63] the replacement of the old aircraft with around 150 new F-35 strike fighters;[64] the conversion of the A11 west of Thetford into a dual carriageway, which was completed in 2014;[65][66] and preventing a waste incinerator being built in King\\'s Lynn.[63] Truss co-founded the Free Enterprise Group (FEG)—a grouping of over 30 Thatcherite Conservative MPs—in October 2011; the month prior, she had co-authored After the Coalition with some of the people that would later join the FEG: Priti Patel, Kwasi Kwarteng, Dominic Raab and Chris Skidmore. The book advocated for a number of policies, including a reduction in the top rate of tax to 40 pence per pound and the introduction of a carbon tax to reduce pollution.[67] On the publication, Truss wrote:\\n', \"Our message must be that the state cannot do everything: while the government can help, it can never fully solve any individual's problems. The NHS[n 3] can't keep you healthy if you don't eat or exercise properly. A teacher can't get you the grades if you aren't prepared to work. The job centre can't find you work if you aren't prepared to write a CV.[68]\", 'Another book by the same authors, Britannia Unchained, was published in September 2012. The book attracted controversy for claiming that \"the British are among the worst idlers in the world. We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor\".[69] In 2022 Truss stated that the authors had each written a different chapter of the book; Raab had written the chapter which contained that claim.[69] Truss soon became well known amongst members of Parliament in Norfolk for her frequent photo ops but was well respected amongst Conservative MPs, who recognised her as dedicated and hard-working, and by staff as attentive to local issues.[70] Some of Truss\\'s earliest contributions to parliamentary discourse were on the subject of education:[71] she advocated for more rigorous teaching in school subjects, especially mathematics,[72] calling for mathematics lessons to be compulsory for all students until the age of 18 and expressing concern about a perceived overreliance on calculators from primary school pupils.[73][74] Truss criticised \"[giving] media studies the same value as further maths\" and suggested in 2011 that students should have to sit GCSEs for \"5 traditional academic subjects\".[75]\\n', 'Education under-secretary (2012–2014)', \"[Y]ou're a great minister, I loved what you did, but we really couldn't go ahead with this one. You're one of the first ministers I've appointed to do something and you've just done it.\\n\", 'David Cameron speaking to Truss about her childcare proposal.[76]', 'In September 2012 Truss was appointed as parliamentary under-secretary of state for education and stepped back from the leadership of the FEG, with Kwarteng taking her place.[77] Truss was pleased with her appointment, and praised Michael Gove, the secretary of state for the department; she also formed a friendly rivalry with the future health secretary Matt Hancock.[78] In January 2013, Truss wrote a white paper—More Great Childcare[79]—in which she proposed increasing the maximum number of children childminders could look after at a time from three to four, as a means of reducing childcare costs.[80][81] The press, including Conservative-leaning papers like The Daily Telegraph and The Times, were largely hostile to the plan. The former claimed that prices would not fall; the latter claimed that \"her appointment signal[led] a rapid deregulation of the sector\"; and the Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee challenged Truss to demonstrate how to care for so many children on her own.[80][82] Following a negative response from trade unions and childminders, Truss met with the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, who told her that \"some of this is fine\" but the maximum childminder increase went \"much too far\", and advised her to revise the proposal;[83] Truss ignored Clegg and pushed ahead with the plan, angering Clegg, who then blocked the proposals.[84][85][86] Truss also announced proposals to reform A-levels by concentrating exams at the end of two-year courses and said that the UK should attempt to \"out-educate\" countries in Asia.[76][87][88]\\n', 'Environment secretary (2014–2016)', 'In July 2014 during a cabinet reshuffle, Truss was appointed secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs;[89] the changes made the Cabinet one third women.[90] Truss was originally to be made a minister of state, but Cameron changed his mind on the morning of the reshuffle.[91] Truss\\'s predecessor Owen Paterson \"stormed out\" of Cameron\\'s Commons study when told he was to be dismissed; nevertheless, he gave her his phone number and offered his support.[92] Paterson was dismissed partly because of his culling plans for badgers with tuberculosis, which Truss later supported.[93][94] Truss\\'s early actions at the department included setting up a \"food crime unit\" to prevent incidents similar to the 2013 horse meat scandal, approving planning for the Thames Tideway Tunnel and development of Flood Re, a scheme designed to insure homes at a high risk of flooding.[95] During her two years in the department Truss launched a ten-year strategy to counter falling bee populations,[96] approved the limited temporary lifting of a European Union ban on the use of two neonicotinoid pesticides[97][98] and cut subsidies for solar panels on agricultural land.[99] In March 2015 Truss was one of two cabinet ministers to vote against the government\\'s proposal to mandate plain packaging for cigarettes.[100] When she had been asked previously about the issue during a constituency meeting, Truss said \"when it comes to things like this, I take a more libertarian approach\\xa0... I don\\'t know if it\\'s the government\\'s role to regulate this\".[101]\\n', 'At the Conservative Party conference in September 2014 Truss made a speech in which she said \"we import two thirds of our cheese. That is a disgrace\" and \"in December, I\\'ll be in Beijing, opening up new pork markets\".[102] Four days after Truss delivered the speech, parts of the video were featured on the satirical panel show Have I Got News For You;[102] the awkward, stilted delivery led her to be mocked and clips of the speech went viral online.[103] During the 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union, Truss endorsed Remain, saying that the Conservatives had \"a golden chance to reform Britain over the next few years\" and to avoid \"[spending] that time negotiating Britain\\'s exit from the European Union\".[104][105] The referendum resulted in the defeat of Remain and Cameron\\'s resignation; the home secretary Theresa May won the ensuing leadership election and subsequently became leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister.[106]\\n', 'Justice secretary and lord chancellor (2016–2017)', 'In July 2016 Truss was appointed as secretary of state for justice and lord chancellor in the first May ministry, becoming the first female lord chancellor in the office\\'s thousand-year history.[107][n 4] May\\'s decision to appoint her was criticised by the minister of state for justice, Edward Faulks, who resigned from the government, questioning whether Truss would \"have the clout to be able to stand up to the Prime Minister when necessary, on behalf of the judges\".[110] Other Conservative members of Parliament criticised Truss\\'s appointment owing to her lack of legal experience; in response, Truss\\'s supporters accused one of the MPs, Bob Neill, of \"thinly veiled misogyny\".[111][112]\\n', '\\nBefore Truss\\'s arrival, the budget of the Ministry of Justice—which is responsible for the administration of British prisons—had been subjected to successive cuts under the coalition government. The cuts were blamed for the prisons\\' rising rates of violence owing to the consequential drop in prison officer numbers.[113][114] Truss lobbied the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, for £104 million in order to hire an additional 2,500 officers, which Hammond reluctantly delivered.[115][116][117] In November 2016, Truss was accused of failing to support the judiciary after three judges of the High Court were criticised by politicians and by the Daily Mail—which ran with the headline \"Enemies of the People\"—for ruling against the government on whether Article 50—which would begin the process of leaving the EU—could be triggered without Parliament\\'s approval.[118] A former lord chancellor, Charlie Falconer, suggested that, like her immediate predecessors, Truss lacked legal expertise and called for her to be dismissed as justice secretary as her perceived inadequate response \"[signalled] to the judges that they have lost their constitutional protector\".[119] She denied that she had failed to defend them, writing:', 'An independent judiciary is the cornerstone of the rule of law, vital to our constitution and freedoms.

I take that very seriously, and I will always do so.[120]', 'Chief secretary to the Treasury (2017–2019)', 'In June, following the 2017 general election, May demoted Truss from justice secretary to chief secretary to the Treasury, meaning she could attend cabinet meetings but was not a full member;[121] Truss was enraged and called the demotion \"incredibly unfair\" and was, according to one of her friends, \"seething for a good couple of days\".[122][123] Despite what Cole and Heale describe as her \"knocked\" confidence from the demotion, Truss soon began to contribute to the department, using it, according to a Treasury worker, \"like her own personal think tank\" by asking for research and advice on monetary policy.[124] In her first few months there, she was largely left out of decision-making processes by Hammond, who was described by Kwarteng as \"quite a closed, centrally controlling chancellor\"; nevertheless, Truss and the Chancellor were reported to have a good relationship.[125] Beginning in December 2017 she developed an enthusiasm for cultivating her presence on Twitter and Instagram; Truss began to plan ministerial visits around photo ops for her social media.[126][127][128] Some of her civil servants were reported as finding her tenure as chief secretary \"exhausting\", owing to her work schedule and asking them multiplication questions, a tactic she had first employed as an MP.[101][129] Despite her governmental role, Truss remained relatively unknown by the public, with only seven per cent recognising her in March 2019.[130]\\n', 'In June 2018 Truss gave a speech criticising rules and regulations which she said \"just g[ot] in the way of consumers\\' choices and lifestyles\", including the government\\'s efforts to reduce alcohol consumption and unhealthy eating habits, and warned that raising taxes could see the Conservatives being \"crushed\" at the polls.[131] She also attacked colleagues who she said should realise \"it\\'s not macho just to demand more money\",[132] a jibe at the defence secretary Gavin Williamson, who had mounted a largely unsuccessful campaign for an extra £20 billion for his department, including threatening to write \"Liz Truss blocked your pay\" to everybody in the British Armed Forces.[133][n 5] Truss\\'s speech, which also mocked Michael Gove, was criticised by Hammond; Ed Vaizey, an ally of Gove\\'s; and Gove himself;[135] a speech she gave in November similarly joked about Matt Hancock, the newly appointed home secretary, Sajid Javid, and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt.[136] Before May\\'s resignation announcement on 24 May 2019 Truss had sought the opinion of her colleagues on whether she could credibly stand and courted media attention.[137][138] As it became apparent she could not win, she ruled herself out the day after May announced her resignation and subsequently endorsed the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, the first minister to do so.[139]\\n', 'International trade secretary (2019–2021)', 'After Johnson became prime minister Truss was widely expected to be promoted because of her endorsement of his leadership campaign; it was thought she might have been appointed chancellor or business secretary, but she was instead promoted to the position of secretary of state for international trade and president of the Board of Trade.[141] Following the resignation of Amber Rudd, Truss was additionally appointed minister for women and equalities in September that year.[142] Shortly after becoming international trade secretary, Truss embarked on international trips to the US, New Zealand, Australia and Japan.[143] Truss met with her American counterpart Robert Lighthizer on her first trip to the US, where she gave what Cole and Heale describe as an \"incendiary\" speech on a potential US–UK trade deal. In Australia she made unscripted comments on their free-trade negotiations with the UK; both events were to the dismay of Downing Street officials.[144] Sebastian Payne described Truss\\'s tenure as international trade secretary as \"enthusiastic yet disruptive\".[145] She continued to document her trips through social media.[146]\\n', 'In February 2020 a reshuffle took place following the general election which had been held in December.[147] Truss feared that she would be dismissed after the comments she had made on her previous international trips, but Johnson decided to keep her in post following Javid\\'s resignation as chancellor.[148] During her time at the department Truss became notorious for leaking information.[149][150] Dominic Cummings, Johnson\\'s chief adviser, later wrote that Truss was \"the only minister I shouted at in Number 10\" because of her \"compulsive pathological leaking\".[149] Truss\\'s pursuit of a trade deal with the US concerned some in the National Farmers\\' Union (NFU), which worried about an influx of lower-quality food products if passed; the NFU, along with The Mail on Sunday, campaigned against such a deal in May.[151][152] The COVID-19 lockdowns eliminated international travel, and Truss instead attended virtual meetings.[153]\\n', 'By early 2021 Truss\\'s attempted US trade deal was deemed futile.[154] Instead, she focused on joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which necessitated free trade agreements with Australia,[155] Japan[156][157][158] and New Zealand.[159] The Australia deal, finalised in December, was described by one of Truss\\'s aides as \"the hardest thing she\\'s ever got through\"; the New Zealand deal was agreed to shortly thereafter.[160] By mid-2021 she had started to ingratiate herself with the parliamentary party in anticipation of a leadership election.[161] In September plans for a National Insurance increase were opposed by Truss; Downing Street expected her resignation, but Truss later decided against it.[162]\\n', 'Foreign secretary (2021–2022)', 'In September 2021, during a cabinet reshuffle, Johnson promoted Truss from international trade secretary to secretary of state for foreign, Commonwealth and development affairs, replacing Dominic Raab, who had been criticised for holidaying in Crete during the Fall of Kabul;[163] the move was despite Johnson finding Truss \"flaky\", according to the historian Anthony Seldon.[164] Truss became the second woman to occupy the office and kept the post of equalities minister.[165] Her early actions as foreign secretary included negotiating at the United Nations General Assembly for the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe;[166][n 6] meeting with her Japanese, Canadian and German counterparts; mounting an unsuccessful attempt to join the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement;[168][169] and a visit to Estonia where—like Margaret Thatcher in West Germany—she was photographed in a tank, with the pictures generating both praise and mockery.[170][171]\\n', \"[W]ho was the person to get the job?

Johnson again considered giving Truss the chancellorship, but decided against it owing to what Payne calls the \"fragile geopolitical situation\" and instead selected Nadhim Zahawi as Sunak\\'s replacement.[185] However, Johnson\\'s premiership proved untenable and on 7 July he announced his resignation as leader of the Conservative Party, a move which Truss called \"the right decision\".[186]\\n', 'Leadership election (July–September 2022)', 'On 10 July Truss announced her intention to run in the leadership election to replace Johnson. She pledged to cut taxes, said she would \"fight the election as a Conservative and govern as a Conservative\" and would take \"immediate action to help people deal with the cost of living\".[187] She said she would cancel a planned rise in corporation tax and reverse the increase in National Insurance rates, funded by delaying the date by which the national debt was planned to fall, as part of a \"long-term plan to bring down the size of the state and the tax burden\".[188] The political scientist Vernon Bogdanor said in a 2022 article that \"[Truss] appreciated that winning over the membership required not detailed policy proposals but the creation of a mood\".[189]\\n', 'Truss received 50 votes on the first of Conservative MPs\\' 5 ballots, with the number of votes cast for her increasing in each;[190] on 20 July[191] Truss and Sunak were chosen by the parliamentary party to be put forward to the membership for the final leadership vote, with Truss receiving 113 votes to Sunak\\'s 137.[192] In the membership vote, the leader of the 1922 Committee,[n 7] Graham Brady, announced on 5 September that 43 per cent of ballots were for Sunak and 57 per cent for Truss, making her the new leader.[194] In Truss\\'s victory speech, she said that she would deliver on her campaign promises and pledged to win a \"great victory\" for the Conservatives at the next general election.[194]\\n', 'Premiership (2022)', 'Cabinet and death of Elizabeth II', 'As the leader of the Conservative Party, the majority party in the House of Commons, Truss was appointed as prime minister by Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle on 6 September 2022 and began to select her cabinet ministers.[195][196][197] With the appointment of Kwarteng as chancellor of the Exchequer, James Cleverly as foreign secretary and Suella Braverman as home secretary, for the first time in British history, no white men held any of the Great Offices of State.[196][198] Other appointments included Thérèse Coffey as deputy prime minister and health secretary, Jacob Rees-Mogg as business secretary, Kemi Badenoch as international trade secretary, Kit Malthouse as education secretary, Penny Mordaunt as leader of the House of Commons and Michelle Donelan as culture secretary.[199] Truss retained Ben Wallace as defence secretary, Alok Sharma as president for COP26, Alister Jack as Scotland secretary, Robert Buckland as Wales secretary and James Heappey as minister of state for the armed forces and veterans.[200] Her cabinet was composed almost entirely of those who had supported her during the leadership contest.[201]\\n', 'Truss was the fifteenth and final British prime minister to serve under Elizabeth II, who died on 8 September, two days after appointing Truss.[202][203] She was told in the early morning that the Queen was unwell and likely to survive a \"matter of hours, not days\";[195] Truss ordered black clothes from her Greenwich home in anticipation of the Queen\\'s death, as she had not had time to move her belongings to Westminster.[204] Upon Elizabeth\\'s death, Truss delivered a statement outside 10 Downing Street paying tribute to her:\\n', 'Queen Elizabeth II was the rock on which modern Britain was built.

We delivered on energy bills and on cutting National Insurance. And we set out a vision for a low-tax, high-growth economy that would take advantage of the freedoms of Brexit. I recognise though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to His Majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. This morning I met the chairman of the 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady.

       "'The \"knights of the shire,\" also known as \"knights of the shire and county,\" were a key part of England\\'s parliamentary system in the medieval and early modern periods. These knights were representatives elected by the landowning, or \"freeholder,\" population of each shire (county) to serve in the Parliament of England, particularly in the House of Commons. Here are some key points about them:\\n\\n1. **Historical Background**: The tradition of electing knights to represent shires dates back to the 13th century during the reign of King Edward I. Specifically, it is often associated with the Model Parliament of 1295, which called for representatives from each shire and borough.\\n\\n2. **Role in Parliament**: The primary function of the knights of the shire was to represent the interests of their shires in the House of Commons. They played a crucial role in discussing and consenting to taxes and legislation that affected the realm.\\n\\n3. **Eligibility and Election**: Originally, to be eligible for election as a knight of the shire, a candidate needed to be a substantial landowner, typically a knight by social status, though not necessarily knighted. In early years, all freeholders who held land worth at least 40 shillings annually (a significant amount at the time) could vote in these elections. \\n\\n4. **Representation**: Each shire typically sent two knights to Parliament, although this number could vary. Some larger or more significant counties had more representation.\\n\\n5. **Impact on Governance**: The inclusion of knights of the shire in Parliament marked a significant development in English governance, reflecting broader representation beyond the nobility and clergy. Their participation underscored the increasing importance of commoners (albeit still a wealthy and influential subset) in the legislative process.\\n\\n6. **Evolution Over Time**: Over the centuries, the role and influence of the knights of the shire evolved, especially as parliamentary democracy further developed. By the time of the reforms in the 19th century, like the Reform Act 1832, the nature of representation and electoral systems had become more complex and inclusive, changing the landscape of parliamentary representation.\\n\\nThe knights of the shire played a foundational role in the development of a more representative and structured parliamentary system in England, contributing to the gradual evolution of more democratic forms of governance.'"
