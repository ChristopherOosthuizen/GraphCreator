The Bills released a statement indicating Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest.\", 'Per the team, he is sedated and in critical condition. The league officially suspended the game following an hour-long stoppage in play.\\xa0', 'The NFL announced Tuesday morning that the game would not be resumed this week.', 'Hamlin was administered CPR on the field, ESPN reported, and he was surrounded by teammates, some of them in tears, after he was hurt while tackling Bengals receiver Tee Higgins.', 'Higgins led the tackle with his right shoulder, which hit Hamlin in the chest. Hamlin then wrapped his arms around Higgins’ shoulders and helmet to drag him down. Hamlin got to his feet, appeared to adjust his face mask with his right hand, and then fell backward about three seconds later and lay motionless.', 'Hamlin was treated on the field by team and independent medical personnel and local paramedics, the NFL said. He was taken by ambulance to University of Cincinnati Medical Center.', 'The NFL issued an announcement a little more than an hour after the game stopped that it would be suspended.', '\"Our thoughts are with Damar and the Buffalo Bills. We will provide more information as it becomes available,\" the league said in a statement. \"The NFL has been in constant communication with the NFL Players Association which is in agreement with postponing the game.\"', 'An ambulance was on the field four minutes after Hamlin collapsed, with many players in tears. The quarterbacks — Buffalo’s Josh Allen and Cincinnati’s Joe Burrow — embraced.', 'Hamlin collapsed at 8:55 p.m., and when he was taken off the field 16 minutes later, the Bills gathered in prayer.\\xa0', 'Five minutes after the ambulance departed, the game was suspended and players walked off the field slowly and into their locker rooms.', 'The Bengals led 7-3 with 5:58 remaining in the first quarter of a game between teams vying for the top playoff seed in the AFC.\\xa0', 'During a media conference call late Monday evening, the NFL did not offer any medical updates on Hamlin or address questions about whether the game will be made up. The Bills are reportedly heading back to Buffalo, while some members of the organization remain in Cincinnati to be near Hamlin.', 'The 24-year-old safety spent five years of college at Pittsburgh — in his hometown — and appeared in 48 games for the Panthers over that span. He was a second-team All-ACC performer as a senior, was voted a team captain and was picked to play in the Senior Bowl.', 'He was drafted in the sixth round by the Bills in 2021, played in 14 games as a rookie and then became a starter this year once Micah Hyde was lost for the season to injury.', 'Entering the game, the 6-foot, 200-pound Hamlin had 91 tackles, including 63 solo tackles and 1 1/2 sacks.', 'This story will be updated with further information.', \"\\n            2024 NFL uniforms: Ravens unveil 'Purple Rising' alternate helmets\\n          \", '\\n            2025 Super Bowl LIX odds: 49ers, Chiefs co-favorites with minicamps ending\\n          ', '\\n            2024-25 NFL MVP odds: Patrick Mahomes favored, C.J.

What Could Go Wrong, Kanye?', 'From Kanye West and Kim Kardashian to Tom Brady and David Beckham, celebrity brand endorsement can ... [+] make millions, or end in tears (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File)', 'Celebrity Brand Endorsement, What Else? George Clooney made an estimated $40 million endorsing Nespresso, while Beyoncé signed a multi-year contract with Pepsi worth $50 million, making the $26 million deal that Taylor Swift signed with Coca-Cola in 2013 look … a little flat.', 'And as Harry Styles and Gucci bring vibrant colour to a new collection, Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappé will be facing off in the World Cup Final, the Argentine kitted out in Adidas and the Frenchman wearing Nike.', 'Using celebrities and athletes to promote your brands has been around for centuries. The gladiators in Rome were commissioned to endorse brands of olive oil. And now with social media, David Beckham and Kim Kardashian bring their enormous fan followings to a proven profit-making tactic for both the celebrity and the brand. So, what could go wrong?', 'Former England and Manchester United footballer David Beckham is under the spotlight for accepting ... [+] an estimated £150m as a brand ambassador for the World Cup in Qatar and faces criticism from human rights and LGBTQ+ activists. (Photo by David Ramos - FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images)', 'In the last few weeks, designer clothing brand Balenciaga announced that it would no longer be working with Kanye West. Adidas, Gap, and Foot Locker soon followed. Meanwhile, NFL Quarterback Tom Brady and supermodel Gidele Bundchen are accused of defrauding investors who lost money in the crypto exchange, FTX. And former England and Manchester United footballer David Beckham is under the spotlight for accepting an estimated £150m as a brand ambassador for the World Cup in Qatar and faces criticism from human rights and LGBTQ+ activists.', 'Best Travel Insurance Companies', 'Best Covid-19 Travel Insurance Plans', 'So how can both brands and celebrities best navigate the potential power and the pitfalls of endorsements? Giana Eckhardt is Professor of Marketing at King’s Business School in London, and a leading expert in the field of consumer behaviour and branding. Her advice is simple. “The brand can look to past behavior to ascertain future risk on implosion (especially online behavior). People will let you know who they are. Look no further than Donald Trump as an exemplar. But the same is true for Kanye West, who has a long history of erratic tweets, for example.', '\"The brand can look to past behavior to ascertain future risk on implosion (especially online ... [+] behavior). People will let you know who they are.\" - Giana Eckhardt, Professor of Marketing at King\\'s Business School', 'For David Dubois, Associate Professor of Marketing at INSEAD and co-Director of the school’s campus and online programme, Leading Digital Marketing Strategy, companies should avoid being overly reliant relying a single individual. “Celebrities are only humans. Companies need to pool the risks by thinking about alliance with many influencers, rather than one. They just need to understand the tactical use and value of celebrities, rather than using them at a strategic level which can be too dangerous.', 'Understanding and managing brands that are also people such as Martha Stewart has been a focus of the research by Giana Eckhardt with Susan Fournier, Dean at Boston University Questrom School of Business, and has been published by the American Marketing Association. In their article, ‘Managing the Risk in Human Brands’, the authors acknowledge that, “Human brands are risk-laden because people present increased chances for undesirable events such as illness or misconduct, and these reputational challenges can diminish returns.”', '“Republicans buy sneakers too.” Michael Jordan preferred not to take public political stances and ... [+] instead focused on basketball.  (Photo by Kelly Kline/WireImage)', 'Nike won’t have any regrets signing with Michael Jordan in 1984, for what was then a five-year deal worth $500,000 a year. But according to Forbes, Adidas may lose $650 Million after dropping Kanye’s Yeezy Line.', '“When considering endorsements and marketing partnerships, the key consideration is whether who the celebrity is as a person is aligned with the brand to be endorsed,” explains Giana Eckhardt. For example, if the celebrity is an adventurer (Richard Branson), so should be the brand. When these are in alignment, authenticity of the endorsement is highest, and as such, the partnership can be mutually enhancing for the brand and celebrity.”', 'Despite the furore over David Beckham’s $150 million 10-year deal as an ambassador for Qatar, Dr. Rajesh Bhargave, Associate Professor of Marketing at Imperial College Business School emphasizes the importance of brand alignment. “There are two sides to every story, and David Beckham probably sees it as ‘I’m here to support the World Cup and football. I grew up playing football, that was my childhood just like so many other kids around the world.’”', \"But Bhargave says that the rules of engagement are different when the celebrity presents themselves as someone who cares a lot about certain causes. “Then they have to be consistent with that going forward. If I was famous footballer, I would be more cautious because I don't want to be tiptoeing all the time.” He points to the example of Michael Jordan who preferred not to take public political stances and instead focused on basketball. “Republicans buy sneakers too.”\", 'Nike struck gold with the Jordan deal 38 years ago, but the sticker price of many celebrity endorsement deals is eye-watering. The star of the hit TV series Modern Family, Sofia Vergara signed deals with Pepsi, Head & Shoulders, and Quaker Oats among others in 2011 worth a reported $94.5 million, while Jay-Z inked a $20 million deal with Samsung and Academy Award winner Charlize Theron signed a $55 million 11-year contract with Dior for the J’adore perfume. These are prohibitive amounts for most brands, and INSEAD’s David Dubois advises companies not to lost sight of their key marketing priorities.', '“The most critical factor is to balance reach and effectiveness. Most companies go for reach - high ... [+] celebrities - which often comes at the expense of effectiveness when celebrity doesn’t transfer to the brand.” David Dubois, Associate Professor of Marketing at INSEAD', '“The most critical factor is to balance reach and effectiveness. Most companies go for reach - high celebrities - which often comes at the expense of effectiveness when celebrity doesn’t transfer to the brand.” In Dubois’ experience, it’s better to go for lower-profile individuals that are closer to the brand DNA. “You can easily find out through basic social media analytics. These lower-profile individuals are closer to their followers, and therefore will make the endorsement/co-branding more effective.”', 'Cristiano Ronaldo is as of this month the most-followed person on Instagram, with over 513 million followers. That in part explains his $1 Billion life-time deal with Nike, which former Forbes Senior Editor Kurt Badenhausen reported may be a bargain for the sportswear giant.', 'Social media has certainly changed the stakes for both brands and celebrities, but Giana Eckhardt at King’s Business School sees both advantages and disadvantages. “Social media simultaneously gives celebrities and brands more control over their relationship with fans and consumers, as it allows them to communicate directly. But they also have less control, as the cultural meaning of brands and celebrities is determined by what others - close others or distant others - say and think about the brand, and what others say on social media cannot be controlled.”', \"Footballer Cristiano Ronaldo removed two Coca-Cola bottles at a press conference and encouraged ... [+] people to drink water instead. This gesture took $4 billion from Coca-Cola's market value and its shares dropped 1.6 per cent. (Photo by UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)\", 'For Eckhardt the key to success in the social media space is authenticity. “PR spin does not work there.”', 'David Dubois insists on the importance of developing a social media content strategy. “Everyone is a media powerhouse, so you need to turn yourself into a content powerhouse. This requires new operational, strategic, and organizational principles.”', 'So, if an MBA student raised their hand during class to ask what advise our experts would give to David Beckham or Kim Kardashian in the face of criticism for their endorsements what would they reply?', '“I would say that it is too late for David Beckham to do anything,” replies Giana Eckhardt, who teaches Brand Management in the MSc Digital Marketing program at King’s Business School. “He already made his choice to be a part of the World Cup in Qatar and cannot get out of it now. If he gave a statement condemning the world cup by simultaneously getting paid from its sponsors, he would never get another endorsement deal.”', 'At INSEAD, David Dubois would encourage running a risk audit over different time frames. In the short term, they need to combine warmth, transparency, expertise and commitment in their messaging. In the long-term, they need to recalibrate their brand DNA through other engagement or rephrasing of the engagement.', '\"What consumers care about is changing, society is changing. People are more passionate about ... [+] certain issues, largely because of social media.\" - Dr. Rajesh Bhargave, Associate Professor of Marketing at Imperial College Business School', \"Dr. Rajesh Bhargave teaches in various programmes at Imperial College Business School, including courses in Ph.D., Executive Education, MBA, and Pre-experience Masters. He notes the legal implications that might arise if David Beckham gives back the £150 million. “Each case is a little different, and it's difficult because the moment they apologize for things it becomes harder and harder and they could be subject to losses.”\", 'For Bhargave one of the key takeaways for students is that certain fundamentals of marketing are still the same. “We must speak to the consumer when the consumer cares. And it is true that what consumers care about is changing, society is changing. People are more passionate about certain issues, largely because of social media. Consumers are more aware, and everything has a trade-off. Both brands and celebrities must think two steps ahead.”', \"Giana Eckhardt recommends Beckham wait things out. “There are many non-human brands who are endorsing the World Cup in Qatar without getting the kind of criticism that Beckham is getting - Budweiser, Adidas, Visa, McDonalds, etc. If he just lays low the social media furor will die down. Ultimately, Beckham's brand capital is bound to football, so in that sense, him endorsing the World Cup is in good alignment.”\", 'There might not be a knighthood this year from King Charles, but for Eckhardt he will not lose any fans over this. “It will be forgotten by the time World Cup 2026 in the U.S. comes around.”', '', 'Join The Conversation', 'One Community.

      "['From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia', 'Contents', 'Academy Award for Best Animated Feature', '\\n', \"The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature is given each year for the best animated film. An animated feature is defined by the academy as a film with a running time of more than 40 minutes in which characters' performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique, a significant number of the major characters are animated, and animation figures in no less than 75 percent of the running time. The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first awarded in 2002 for films released in 2001.[1][2][3]\\n\", \"The entire AMPAS membership has been eligible to choose the winner since the award's inception. If there are sixteen or more films submitted for the category, the winner is voted from a shortlist of five films, otherwise there will only be three films on the shortlist.[4]\\n\", 'History[edit]', \"For much of the Academy Awards' history, AMPAS was resistant to the idea of a regular award for animated features, considering there were simply too few produced to justify such consideration.[5] Instead, the Academy occasionally bestowed special Oscars for exceptional productions, usually for Walt Disney Pictures, such as for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1938,[6] and the Special Achievement Academy Award for the live action/animated hybrid Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1989[7] and Toy Story in 1996.[8] In fact, prior to the award's creation, only one animated film was nominated for Best Picture: 1991's Beauty and the Beast, also by Disney.[9][10]\\n\", 'By 2001, the rise of sustained competitors to Disney in the feature animated film market, such as DreamWorks Animation (founded by former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg), created an increase of film releases of significant annual number enough for AMPAS to reconsider.[5] The Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was first given out at the 74th Academy Awards,[11] held on March 24, 2002.[12] The academy included a rule that stated that the award would not be presented in a year in which fewer than eight eligible films opened in theaters.[13] It dropped the rule on April 23, 2019, to make voting for animated films more acceptable.[14] People in the animation industry, as well as fans, expressed hope that the prestige from this award and the resulting boost to the box office would encourage the increased production of animated features.[citation needed]\\n', 'In 2009, when the nominee slots for Best Picture were doubled to ten, Up was nominated for both Animated Feature and Picture at the 82nd Academy Awards, the first to do so since the inception of the Animated Feature category. This feat was repeated the following year by Toy Story 3.[citation needed]\\n', 'In 2010, the academy enacted a new rule regarding the motion capture technique employed in films such as A Christmas Carol (2009) and The Adventures of Tintin (2011), directed by Academy Award for Best Director winners Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg respectively, and how they might not be eligible in this category in the future.[clarification needed] This rule was possibly made to prevent nominations of live-action films that rely heavily on motion capture, such as Avatar (2009).[citation needed]\\n', \"In 2022, it was unclear whether Marcel the Shell with Shoes On would be eligible for the award at the 95th Academy Awards due to being a live-action/stop-motion animated hybrid. Director Dean Fleischer Camp said that he and A24 had to submit documentation in order to prove the film had enough animation to meet the award's minimum requirements.[15][16] Nonetheless, the AMPAS officially deemed the film eligible for consideration in the Animated Feature category and was eventually nominated for said category.[17]\\n\", 'Best Picture criticism[edit]', 'Some members and fans have criticized the award, however, saying it is only intended to prevent animated films from having a chance of winning Best Picture. DreamWorks had advertised heavily during the holiday 2001 season for Shrek, but was disappointed when the rumored Best Picture nomination did not materialize, though it was nominated for and ultimately won the inaugural Best Animated Feature award.[1]\\n', 'The criticism surrounding the Best Animated Feature category was particularly prominent at the 81st Academy Awards, in which WALL-E won the award but was not nominated for Best Picture, despite receiving widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike and being generally considered to be one of the best films of 2008.[18][19][20][21] This sparked controversy over whether the film was deliberately snubbed of such nomination by the academy. Film critic Peter Travers commented that \"if there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved to be nominated for Best Picture, it\\'s WALL-E.\" However, official Academy Award regulations state that any film nominated for this category can still be nominated for Best Picture.[4] This, as well as more backlash that The Dark Knight was also not another Best Picture nominee meant that next year, the academy expanded the Best Picture category.[22] After the expansion, two animated films—Up (2009) and Toy Story 3 (2010)—were nominated for Best Picture.[23]\\n', \"From 2010 onward, with the increasing competitiveness of the Animated Feature category, Pixar (a perennial nominee) did not receive nominations for several recent films due to the more mixed critical response and comparatively low box-office receipts, while Pixar's sister studio Disney Animation won their first three awards.[24]\\n\", 'Winners and nominees[edit]', '2000s[edit]', '2010s[edit]', '2020s[edit]', 'Multiple wins and nominations[edit]', 'Multiple wins[edit]', 'Multiple nominations[edit]', '\\n', 'Studios and franchises with multiple nominations[edit]', 'Studios[edit]', 'Franchises[edit]', 'Notes[edit]', '\\n^ a b Co-production between Aardman Animations and DreamWorks Animation\\n\\n^ a b Co-production between Aardman Animations and Sony Pictures Animation\\n\\n^ a b Co-production between Laika and Tim Burton Productions\\n\\n^ a b Co-production between Cartoon Saloon and Les Armateurs\\n\\n^ Co-production between Annapurna Animation and Blue Sky Studios\\n\\n', 'Age superlatives[edit]', 'Milestones[edit]', 'Studios and films[edit]', 'People[edit]', 'See also[edit]', 'References[edit]', '\\n^ a b \"15 Amazing Animated Movies That Were Snubbed By The Oscars\".

      "['From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia', 'Contents', 'Jaws (film)', '\\n', \"Jaws is a 1975 American  thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg, based on the 1974 novel by Peter Benchley. It stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody, who, with the help of a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a professional shark hunter (Robert Shaw), hunts a man-eating great white shark that attacks beachgoers at a summer resort town. Murray Hamilton plays the mayor, and Lorraine Gary portrays Brody's wife. The screenplay is credited to Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer Carl Gottlieb, who rewrote the script during principal photography.\\n\", \"Shot mostly on location at Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts from May to October of 1974, Jaws was the first major motion picture to be shot on the ocean and consequently had a troubled production, going over budget and schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks often malfunctioned, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the shark's presence, employing an ominous and minimalist theme created by composer John Williams to indicate its impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of director Alfred Hitchcock. Universal Pictures' release of the film to over 450 screens was an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture at the time, and it was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign that heavily emphasized television spots and tie-in merchandise.\\n\", 'Regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history, Jaws was the prototypical summer blockbuster and won several awards for its music and editing. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until the release of Star Wars two years later; both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which pursues high box-office returns from action and adventure films with simple high-concept premises, released during the summer in thousands of theaters and advertised heavily. Jaws was followed by three sequels (none of which involved Spielberg or Benchley) and many imitative thrillers. In 2001, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\\n', 'Plot', \"In the New England beach town of Amity Island, a young woman goes for a late-night ocean swim during a beach party. An unseen force attacks and pulls her underwater. Her remains are found washed up on the beach the next morning. After the medical examiner concludes it was a shark attack, newly hired police chief Martin Brody closes the beaches; Mayor Larry Vaughn persuades him to reconsider, fearing the town's summer economy will suffer. The coroner, apparently under pressure, now concurs with the mayor's theory that it was a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until a young boy, Alex Kintner, is killed at a crowded beach. A bounty is placed on the shark, causing an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Quint, an eccentric and roughened local shark hunter, offers his services for $10,000. Consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines the girl's remains, confirming that an abnormally large shark killed her.\\n\", \"When local fishermen catch a tiger shark, Vaughn declares the beaches safe. A skeptical Hooper dissects the tiger shark and, finding no human remains inside its stomach, concludes that the real shark is still out there. While searching the night waters in Hooper's boat, Hooper and Brody find the half-sunken boat of Ben Gardner, a local fisherman. Hooper dons a scuba suit and goes underwater to check the boat's hull, where he finds a shark tooth embedded into it. He accidentally drops the tooth in fright after encountering Gardner's corpse. Vaughn dismisses Brody and Hooper's assertions that a great white shark caused the deaths and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only increased safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. The shark enters a nearby lagoon, killing a boater and coming close to killing Brody's son. Brody then convinces a guilt-ridden Vaughn to hire Quint.\\n\", \"Despite initial tension between Quint and Hooper, they and Brody head out to sea on Quint's boat to hunt for the shark. As Brody lays down a chum line, the shark suddenly appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating it is 25 feet (7.6\\xa0m) long and weighs 3 tonnes (3.0 long tons; 3.3 short tons), harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.\\n\", \"At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted body scars. One of Quint's is a removed tattoo, and he reveals that he survived the attack on the USS\\xa0Indianapolis, during which many US sailors were killed by sharks. The shark returns, ramming the boat's hull and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons the shark with another barrel. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. As Quint is about to sever the line to save the boat's transom, the cleats break off. The barrels stay attached to the shark. To Brody's relief, Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but the overtaxed engine fails.\\n\", \"As the boat takes on water, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper suits up and enters a shark-proof cage, intending to lethally inject the shark with strychnine via a hypodermic spear. The shark viciously attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear. While the shark destroys the cage, Hooper escapes to the seabed. The shark leaps onto the boat's stern, subsequently devouring Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody shoves a scuba tank into the shark's mouth and, climbing onto the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island, clinging to the remaining barrels.\\n\", 'Production', 'Development', 'Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown, producers at Universal Pictures, independently heard about Peter Benchley\\'s novel Jaws. Brown came across it in the literature section of lifestyle magazine Cosmopolitan, then edited by his wife, Helen Gurley Brown. A small card written by the magazine\\'s book editor gave a detailed description of the plot, concluding with the comment \"might make a good movie\".[3][4] The producers each read the book over the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was \"the most exciting thing that they had ever read\" and that they wanted to produce a film version, although they were unsure how it would be accomplished.[5] They purchased the film rights in 1973, before the book\\'s publication, for approximately $175,000 (equivalent to $1,200,000 in 2023).[6] Brown claimed that had they read the book twice, they would never have made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences.[7]\\n', 'To direct, Zanuck and Brown first considered veteran filmmaker John Sturges—whose résumé included another maritime adventure, The Old Man and the Sea—before offering the job to Dick Richards, whose directorial debut, The Culpepper Cattle Co., had come out the previous year.[8] They soon grew irritated by Richards\\'s habit of describing the shark as a whale and dropped him from the project.[8] Meanwhile, Steven Spielberg very much wanted the job. The 26-year-old had just directed his first theatrical film, The Sugarland Express, for Zanuck and Brown. At the end of a meeting in their office, Spielberg noticed their copy of the still-unpublished Benchley novel, and after reading it was immediately captivated.[6] He later observed that it was similar to his 1971 television film Duel in that both deal with \"these leviathans targeting everymen\".[5] He also revealed in \"The Making of Jaws\" documentary on the 2012 DVD release that he directly referenced Duel by repurposing the sound of the truck being destroyed as the death roar of the shark. After Richards\\'s departure, the producers signed Spielberg to direct in June 1973, before the release of The Sugarland Express.[8]\\n', 'Before production began, Spielberg grew reluctant to continue with Jaws, in fear of becoming typecast as the \"truck and shark director\".[9] He wanted to move over to 20th Century Fox\\'s Lucky Lady instead, but Universal exercised its right under its contract with the director to veto his departure.[10] Brown helped convince Spielberg to stick with the project, saying that \"after [Jaws], you can make all the films you want\".[9] The film was given an estimated budget of $3.5\\xa0million and a shooting schedule of 55\\xa0days. Principal photography was set to begin in May 1974. Universal wanted the shoot to finish by the end of June, when the major studios\\' contract with the Screen Actors Guild was due to expire, to avoid any disruptions due to a potential strike.[11]\\n', 'Writing', 'For the screen adaptation, Spielberg wanted to stay with the novel\\'s basic plot, but discarded many of Benchley\\'s subplots.[6] He declared that his favorite part of the book was the shark hunt on the last 120\\xa0pages, and told Zanuck when he accepted the job, \"I\\'d like to do the picture if I could change the first two acts and base the first two acts on original screenplay material, and then be very true to the book for the last third.\"[12] When the producers purchased the rights to his novel, they promised Benchley that he could write the first draft of the screenplay.[6] The intent was to make sure a script could be done despite an impending threat of a Writer\\'s Guild strike, given Benchley was not unionized.[13] Overall, he wrote three drafts before the script was turned over to other writers;[6] delivering his final version to Spielberg, he declared, \"I\\'m written out on this, and that\\'s the best I can do.\"[14] Benchley later described his contribution to the finished film as \"the storyline and the ocean stuff—basically, the mechanics\", given he \"didn\\'t know how to put the character texture into a screenplay.\"[13] One of his changes was to remove the novel\\'s adulterous affair between Ellen Brody and Matt Hooper, at the suggestion of Spielberg, who feared it would compromise the camaraderie between the men on the Orca.[15] During the film\\'s production, Benchley agreed to return and play a small onscreen role as a reporter.[16]\\n', 'Spielberg, who felt that the characters in Benchley\\'s script were still unlikable, invited the young screenwriter John Byrum to do a rewrite, but he declined the offer.[9] Columbo creators William Link and Richard Levinson also declined Spielberg\\'s invitation.[17] Tony and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Howard Sackler was in Los Angeles when the filmmakers began looking for another writer and offered to do an uncredited rewrite; since the producers and Spielberg were unhappy with Benchley\\'s drafts, they quickly agreed.[5] At the suggestion of Spielberg, Brody\\'s characterization made him afraid of water, \"coming from an urban jungle to find something more terrifying off this placid island near Massachusetts.\"[13]\\n', 'Spielberg wanted \"some levity\" in Jaws, humor that would avoid making it \"a dark sea hunt\", so he turned to his friend Carl Gottlieb, a comedy writer-actor then working on the sitcom The Odd Couple.[14] Spielberg sent Gottlieb a script, asking what the writer would change and if there was a role he would be interested in performing.[18] Gottlieb sent Spielberg three pages of notes, and picked the part of Meadows, the politically connected editor of the local paper. He passed the audition one week before Spielberg took him to meet the producers regarding a writing job.[19]\\n', 'While the deal was initially for a \"one-week dialogue polish\", Gottlieb eventually became the primary screenwriter, rewriting nearly the entire script during a nine-week period of principal photography.[19] The script for each scene was typically finished the night before it was shot, after Gottlieb had dinner with Spielberg and members of the cast and crew to decide what would go into the film. Many pieces of dialogue originated from the actors\\' improvisations during these meals; a few were created on set just prior to filming. John Milius contributed other dialogue polishes,[20] and Sugarland Express writers Matthew Robbins and Hal Barwood also made uncredited contributions.[21] Spielberg has claimed that he prepared his own draft, although it is unclear to what degree the other screenwriters drew on his material.[20] One specific alteration he called for in the story was to change the cause of the shark\\'s death from extensive wounds to a scuba tank explosion, as he felt audiences would respond better to a \"big rousing ending\".[22] The director estimated the final script had a total of 27 scenes that were not in the book.[15]\\n', 'Benchley had written Jaws after reading about sport fisherman Frank Mundus\\'s capture of an enormous shark in 1964. According to Gottlieb, Quint was loosely based on Mundus, whose book Sportfishing for Sharks he read for research.[23] Sackler came up with the backstory of Quint as a survivor of the World War II USS\\xa0Indianapolis disaster.[24] The question of who deserves the most credit for writing Quint\\'s monologue about the Indianapolis has caused substantial controversy. Spielberg described it as a collaboration between Sackler, Milius, and actor Robert Shaw, who was also a playwright.[20] According to the director, Milius turned Sackler\\'s \"three-quarters of a page\" speech into a monologue, and that was then partially rewritten by Shaw.[24] Gottlieb gives primary credit to Shaw, downplaying Milius\\'s contribution.[25][26]\\n', 'Casting', 'Though Spielberg complied with a request from Zanuck and Brown to cast known actors,[16] he wanted to avoid hiring any big stars. He felt that \"somewhat anonymous\" performers would help the audience \"believe this was happening to people like you and me\", whereas \"stars bring a lot of memories along with them, and those memories can sometimes\\xa0... corrupt the story.\"[21] The director added that in his plans \"the superstar was gonna be the shark\".[14] The first actors cast were Lorraine Gary, the wife of president of Universal Sidney Sheinberg, as Ellen Brody,[16] and Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island.[27] Stuntwoman-turned-actress Susan Backlinie was cast as Chrissie (the first victim) as she knew how to swim and was willing to perform nude.[14] Most minor roles were played by residents of Martha\\'s Vineyard, where the film was shot. One example was Deputy Hendricks, played by future television producer Jeffrey Kramer.[28] Lee Fierro plays Mrs. Kintner, the mother of the shark\\'s second victim Alex Kintner (played by Jeffrey Voorhees).[29]\\n', 'The role of Brody was offered to Robert Duvall, but the actor was interested only in portraying Quint.[30] Charlton Heston expressed a desire for the role but Spielberg felt that Heston would bring a screen persona too grand for the part of a police chief of a modest community.[31] Roy Scheider became interested in the project after overhearing Spielberg at a party talk with a screenwriter about having the shark jump up onto a boat.[16] Spielberg was initially apprehensive about hiring Scheider, fearing he would portray a \"tough guy\", similar to his role in The French Connection.[30]\\n', 'Nine days before the start of production, neither Quint nor Hooper had been cast.[32] The role of Quint was originally offered to actors Lee Marvin and Sterling Hayden, both of whom passed.[16][30] Zanuck and Brown had just finished working with Robert Shaw on The Sting, and suggested him to Spielberg.[33] Shaw was reluctant to take the role since he did not like the book but decided to accept at the urging of both his wife, actress Mary Ure and his secretary—\"The last time they were that enthusiastic was From Russia with Love. And they were right\".[34] Shaw based his performance on fellow cast member Craig Kingsbury, a local fisherman, farmer and legendary eccentric, who was cast in the small role of fisherman Ben Gardner.[35] Spielberg described Kingsbury as \"the purest version of who, in my mind, Quint was\" and some of his offscreen utterances were incorporated into the script as lines of both Gardner and Quint.[36] Another source for some of Quint\\'s dialogue and mannerisms, especially in the third act at sea, was Vineyard mechanic and boat-owner Lynn Murphy.[37][38]\\n', 'For the role of Hooper, Spielberg initially wanted Jon Voight.[33] Timothy Bottoms, Jan-Michael Vincent, Joel Grey, and Jeff Bridges were also considered for the part.[39][40][41] Spielberg\\'s friend George Lucas suggested Richard Dreyfuss, whom he had directed in American Graffiti.[16] The actor initially passed but changed his decision after he attended a pre-release screening of The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, which he had just completed. Disappointed in his performance and fearing that no one would want to hire him once Kravitz was released, he immediately called Spielberg and accepted the role in Jaws. Because the film the director envisioned was so dissimilar to Benchley\\'s novel, Spielberg asked Dreyfuss not to read it.[42] As a result of the casting, Hooper was rewritten to better suit the actor,[32] as well as to be more representative of Spielberg, who came to view Dreyfuss as his \"alter ego\".[41]\\n', 'Filming', 'We started the film without a script, without a cast and without a shark.\\n', \"—Actor Richard Dreyfuss on the film's troubled production[43]\", 'Principal photography began May 2, 1974,[44] on the island of Martha\\'s Vineyard, Massachusetts, selected after consideration was given to eastern Long Island. Brown explained later that the production \"needed a vacation area that was lower middle class enough so that an appearance of a shark would destroy the tourist business.\"[45] Martha\\'s Vineyard was also chosen because the surrounding ocean had a sandy bottom that never dropped below 35 feet (11\\xa0m) for 12 miles (19\\xa0km) out from shore, which allowed the mechanical sharks to operate while also beyond sight of land.[46] As Spielberg wanted to film the aquatic sequences relatively close-up to resemble what people see while swimming, cinematographer Bill Butler devised new equipment to facilitate marine and underwater shooting, including a rig to keep the camera stable, regardless of tide, and a sealed submersible camera box.[47] Spielberg asked the art department to avoid red in both scenery and wardrobe, so that the blood from the attacks would be the only red element and cause a bigger shock.[36]\\n', 'Initially the film\\'s producers wanted to train a great white shark[49] but quickly realized this was not possible, so three full-size pneumatically powered prop sharks—which the film crew nicknamed \"Bruce\" after Spielberg\\'s lawyer, Bruce Ramer—were made for the production:[50] a \"sea-sled shark\", a full-body prop with its belly missing that was towed with a 300-foot (91\\xa0m) line, and two \"platform sharks\", one that moved from camera-left to right (with its hidden left side exposing an array of pneumatic hoses), and an opposite model with its right flank uncovered.[6] The sharks were designed by art director and production designer Joe Alves during the third quarter of 1973. Between November 1973 and April 1974, the sharks were fabricated at Rolly Harper\\'s Motion Picture & Equipment Rental in Sun Valley, California. Their construction involved a team of as many as 40 effects technicians, supervised by mechanical effects supervisor Bob Mattey, best known for creating the giant squid in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. After the sharks were completed, they were trucked to the shooting location.[51] In early July, the platform used to tow the two side-view sharks capsized as it was being lowered to the ocean floor, forcing a team of divers to retrieve it.[52] The model required 14 operators to control all of the moving parts.[42] For Quint\\'s boat, the Orca, Alves and his team constructed two identical 42-foot models for the film. The second boat, dubbed Orca II, had no motor and was designed to sink on command.[53]\\n', 'Jaws was the first major motion picture to be shot on the ocean,[54] resulting in a troubled shoot, and went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget \"was $4\\xa0million and the picture wound up costing $9\\xa0million\";[55] the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks.[56] Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname \"Flaws\".[42][50] Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; \"I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same,\" he said.[34] As for his lack of experience: \"I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but I was too young to know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank.\"[24] Gottlieb said that \"there was nothing to do except make the movie\", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer he did not have to attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived \"ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water\".[13]\\n', 'Shooting at sea led to many delays: unwanted sailboats drifted into frame, cameras got soaked,[36] and the Orca once began to sink with the actors on board.[57] The prop sharks frequently malfunctioned owing to a series of problems including bad weather, pneumatic hoses taking on salt water, frames fracturing due to water resistance, corroding skin, and electrolysis. From the first water test onward, the \"non-absorbent\" neoprene foam that made up the sharks\\' skin soaked up liquid, causing the sharks to balloon, and the sea-sled model frequently got entangled among forests of seaweed.[34][52] Spielberg later calculated that during the 12-hour daily work schedule, on average only four hours were actually spent filming.[58] Gottlieb was nearly decapitated by the boat\\'s propellers, and Dreyfuss was almost imprisoned in the steel cage.[34] The actors were frequently seasick. Shaw also fled to Canada whenever he could due to tax problems,[59] engaged in binge drinking, and developed a grudge against Dreyfuss, who was getting rave reviews for his performance in Duddy Kravitz.[14][60] Editor Verna Fields rarely had material to work with during principal photography, as according to Spielberg \"we would shoot five scenes in a good day, three in an average day, and none in a bad day.\"[61]\\n', 'The delays proved beneficial in some regards. The script was refined during production, and the unreliable mechanical sharks forced Spielberg to shoot many scenes so that the shark was only hinted at. For example, for much of the shark hunt, its location is indicated by the floating yellow barrels.[62] The opening had the shark devouring Chrissie,[14] but it was rewritten so that it would be shot with Backlinie being dragged and yanked by cables to simulate an attack.[36] Spielberg also included multiple shots of just the dorsal fin. This forced restraint is widely thought to have added to the film\\'s suspense.[62] As Spielberg put it years later, \"The film went from a Japanese Saturday matinee horror flick to more of a Hitchcock, the less-you-see-the-more-you-get thriller.\"[42] In another interview, he similarly declared, \"The shark not working was a godsend. It made me become more like Alfred Hitchcock than like Ray Harryhausen.\" The acting became crucial for making audiences believe in such a big shark: \"The more fake the shark looked in the water, the more my anxiety told me to heighten the naturalism of the performances.\"[24]\\n', 'Footage of real sharks was shot by Ron and Valerie Taylor in the waters off Dangerous Reef in South Australia, with a short actor in a miniature shark cage to create the illusion that the sharks were enormous.[63] During the Taylors\\' shoot, a great white attacked the boat and cage. The footage of the cage attack was so stunning that Spielberg was eager to incorporate it in the film. No one had been in the cage at the time and the script, following the novel, originally had the shark killing Hooper in it. The storyline was consequently altered to have Hooper escape from the cage, which allowed the footage to be used.[64][65] As production executive Bill Gilmore put it, \"The shark down in Australia rewrote the script and saved Dreyfuss\\'s character.\"[66]\\n', 'Although principal photography was scheduled to take 55 days, it did not wrap until October 6, 1974, after 159 days.[42][44] Spielberg, reflecting on the protracted shoot, stated, \"I thought my career as a filmmaker was over. I heard rumors\\xa0... that I would never work again because no one had ever taken a film 100 days over schedule.\"[42] Spielberg himself was not present for the shooting of the final scene in which the shark explodes, as he believed that the crew were planning to throw him in the water when the scene was done.[22] It has since become a tradition for Spielberg to be absent when the final scene of one of his films is being shot.[67] Afterward, underwater scenes were shot at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer water tank in Culver City, with stuntmen Dick Warlock and Frank James Sparks as stand-ins for Dreyfuss in the scene where the shark attacks the cage,[68] as well as near Santa Catalina Island, California. Fields, who had completed a rough cut of the first two-thirds of the film, up until the shark hunt, finished the editing and reworked some of the material. According to Zanuck, \"She actually came in and reconstructed some scenes that Steven had constructed for comedy and made them terrifying, and some scenes he shot to be terrifying and made them comedy scenes.\"[69] The boat used for the Orca was brought to Los Angeles so the sound effects team could record sounds for both the ship and the underwater scenes.[70]\\n', 'Two scenes were altered following test screenings. As the audience\\'s screams had covered up Scheider\\'s \"bigger boat\" one-liner, Brody\\'s reaction after the shark jumps behind him was extended, and the volume of the line was raised.[71][72] Spielberg also decided that he was greedy for \"one more scream\", and reshot the scene in which Hooper discovers Ben Gardner\\'s body, using $3,000 of his own money after Universal refused to pay for the reshoot. The underwater scene was shot in Fields\\'s swimming pool in Encino, California,[73] using a lifecast latex model of Craig Kingsbury\\'s head attached to a fake body, which was placed in the wrecked boat\\'s hull.[36] To simulate the murky waters of Martha\\'s Vineyard, powdered milk was poured into the pool, which was then covered with a tarpaulin.[13]\\n', 'Music', 'John Williams composed the film\\'s score, which earned him an Academy Award and was later ranked the sixth-greatest score by the American Film Institute.[75][76] The main \"shark\" theme, a simple alternating pattern of two notes—variously identified as \"E and F\"[77] or \"F and F sharp\"[78]—became a classic piece of suspense music, synonymous with approaching danger[79] (see leading-tone). Williams described the theme as \"grinding away at you, just as a shark would do, instinctual, relentless, unstoppable.\"[80] The piece was performed by tuba player Tommy Johnson. When asked by Johnson why the melody was written in such a high register and not played by the more appropriate French horn, Williams responded that he wanted it to sound \"a little more threatening\".[81] When Williams first demonstrated his idea to Spielberg, playing just the two notes on a piano, Spielberg was said to have laughed, thinking that it was a joke. As Williams saw similarities between Jaws and pirate movies, at other points in the score he evoked \"pirate music\", which he called \"primal, but fun and entertaining\".[74] Calling for rapid, percussive string playing, the score contains echoes of Claude Debussy\\'s La mer and of Igor Stravinsky\\'s The Rite of Spring.[78][82]\\n', 'There are various interpretations of the meaning and effectiveness of the primary music theme, which is widely described as one of the most recognizable cinematic themes of all time.[83] Music scholar Joseph Cancellaro proposes that the two-note expression mimics the shark\\'s heartbeat.[84] According to Alexandre Tylski, like themes Bernard Herrmann wrote for Taxi Driver, North by Northwest, and particularly Mysterious Island, it suggests human respiration. He further argues that the score\\'s strongest motif is actually \"the split, the rupture\"—when it dramatically cuts off, as after Chrissie\\'s death.[78] The relationship between sound and silence is also taken advantage of in the way the audience is conditioned to associate the shark with its theme,[80] which is exploited toward the film\\'s climax when the shark suddenly appears with no musical introduction.[83]\\n', \"Spielberg later said that without Williams's score the film would have been only half as successful, and according to Williams it jumpstarted his career.[74] He had previously scored Spielberg's debut feature, The Sugarland Express, and went on to collaborate with the director on almost all of his films.[80] The original soundtrack for Jaws was released by MCA Records on LP in 1975, and as a CD in 1992, including roughly a half hour of music that Williams redid for the album.[85][86] In 2000, two versions of the score were released: Decca/Universal reissued the soundtrack album to coincide with the release of the 25th-anniversary DVD, featuring the entire 51 minutes of the original score,[85][86] and Varèse Sarabande put out a rerecording of the score performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, conducted by Joel McNeely.[87]\\n\", 'Themes', 'Influences', 'Herman Melville\\'s Moby-Dick is the most notable artistic antecedent to Jaws. The character of Quint strongly resembles Captain Ahab, the obsessed captain of the Pequod who devotes his life to hunting a sperm whale. Quint\\'s monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks; even his boat, the Orca, is named after the only natural enemy of the white shark. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar to the death of Ahab in Melville\\'s novel.[88] A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg\\'s draft of the screenplay, which introduces Quint watching the film version of Moby-Dick; his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to get up and leave the theater. However, the scene from Moby-Dick could not be licensed from the film\\'s star, Gregory Peck, its copyright holder.[5] Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to Ernest Hemingway\\'s The Old Man and the Sea: \"Jaws is\\xa0... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway.\"[23]\\n', 'The underwater scenes shot from the shark\\'s point of view have been compared with passages in two 1950s horror films, Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Monster That Challenged the World.[89][90] Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: The Thing from Another World, which Gottlieb described as \"a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel\";[91] and It Came From Outer Space, where \"the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera\". Those precedents helped Spielberg and Gottlieb to \"concentrate on showing the \\'effects\\' of the shark rather than the shark itself\".[92] Scholars such as Thomas Schatz have described how Jaws melds various genres while essentially being an action film and a thriller. Most is taken from horror, with the core of a nature-based monster movie while adding elements of a slasher film. The second half is both a buddy film in the interaction between the crew of the Orca, and a supernatural horror based on the shark\\'s depiction of a nearly Satanic menace.[93] Ian Freer describes Jaws as an aquatic monster movie, citing the influence of earlier monster films such as King Kong and Godzilla.[94] Charles Derry, in 1977, also compared Jaws to Godzilla;[95] and Spielberg cited Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956) as a formative influence growing up, due to the \"masterful\" way in which \"it made you believe it was really happening.\"[96]\\n', 'Critics such as Neil Sinyard have described similarities to Henrik Ibsen\\'s play An Enemy of the People.[97] Gottlieb himself said he and Spielberg referred to Jaws as \"Moby-Dick meets Enemy of the People\".[98] The Ibsen work features a doctor who discovers that a seaside town\\'s medicinal hot springs, a major tourist attraction and revenue source, are contaminated. When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in Jaws by Brody\\'s conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a \"deft combination of Watergate and Ibsen\\'s play\".[97]\\n', 'Scholarly criticism', 'Jaws has received attention from academic critics. Stephen Heath relates the film\\'s ideological meanings to the then-recent Watergate scandal. He argues that Brody represents the \"white male middle class—[there is] not a single black and, very quickly, not a single woman in the film\", who restores public order \"with an ordinary-guy kind of heroism born of fear-and-decency\".[99] Yet Heath moves beyond ideological content analysis to examine Jaws as a signal example of the film as \"industrial product\" that sells on the basis of \"the pleasure of cinema, thus yielding the perpetuation of the industry (which is why part of the meaning of Jaws is to be the most profitable movie)\".[100]\\n', 'Andrew Britton contrasts the film to the novel\\'s post-Watergate cynicism, suggesting that its narrative alterations from the book (Hooper\\'s survival, the shark\\'s explosive death) help make it \"a communal exorcism, a ceremony for the restoration of ideological confidence.\" He suggests that the experience of the film is \"inconceivable\" without the mass audience\\'s jubilation when the shark is annihilated, signifying the obliteration of evil itself.[101] In his view, Brody serves to demonstrate that \"individual action by the one just man is still a viable source for social change\".[102] Peter Biskind argues that the film does maintain post-Watergate cynicism concerning politics and politicians insofar as the sole villain beside the shark is the town\\'s venal mayor. Yet he observes that, far from the narrative formulas so often employed by New Hollywood filmmakers of the era—involving Us vs. Them, hip counterculture figures vs. \"The Man\"—the overarching conflict in Jaws does not pit the heroes against authority figures, but against a menace that targets everyone regardless of socioeconomic position.[103]\\n', 'Whereas Britton states that the film avoids the novel\\'s theme of social class conflicts on Amity Island,[102] Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance. \"Authority must be restored\", he writes, \"but not by Quint\". The seaman\\'s \"working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening\\xa0... irrational and out of control\". Hooper, meanwhile, is \"associated with technology rather than experience, inherited wealth rather than self-made sufficiency\"; he is marginalized from the conclusive action, if less terminally than Quint.[104] Britton sees the film more as concerned with the \"vulnerability of children and the need to protect and guard them\", which in turn helps generate a \"pervasive sense of the supreme value of family life: a value clearly related to [ideological] stability and cultural continuity\".[105]\\n', 'Fredric Jameson\\'s analysis highlights the polysemy of the shark and the multiple ways in which it can be and has been read—from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death. He asserts that its symbolic function is to be found in this very \"polysemousness which is profoundly ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently \\'natural\\' ones\\xa0... to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence.\"[106] He views Quint\\'s demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old, populist, New Deal America and Brody and Hooper\\'s partnership as an \"allegory of an alliance between the forces of law-and-order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations\\xa0... in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it.\"[107]\\n', 'Neal Gabler analyzed the film as showing three different approaches to solving an obstacle: science (represented by Hooper), spiritualism (represented by Quint), and the common man (represented by Brody). The last of the three is the one which succeeds and is in that way endorsed by the film.[108]\\n', 'Audience emotional response', 'While in theaters, the film was said to have caused a single case of cinematic neurosis in a 17-year-old, female viewer.[109] Cinematic neurosis is a condition in which viewers exhibit mental health disturbances, or a worsening of existing mental health disturbances, after viewing a film.[110] The symptoms first presented as sleep disturbances and anxiety, but one day later the patient was screaming \"Sharks! Sharks!\" and experiencing convulsions.[111]\\n', 'This case study caused the film to become notable in the medical community alongside The Exorcist for causing stress reactions in its viewers, and was later used in a study by Brian R. Johnson to test how susceptible audiences were to cinematic stress inducers.[112] His study found that stress could be induced by cinema in segments of the general population, and Jaws specifically caused stress reactions in its viewers. While Johnson could not find an exact cause for the stress response in viewers, whether it be the suspense, the gore or the music production, a 1986 study by G. Sparks found that particularly violent films, including Jaws, tended to cause the most intense reactions in viewers.[113]\\n', 'Release', 'Marketing', 'Universal spent $1.8 million marketing Jaws, including an unprecedented $700,000 on national television spot advertising.[43][114] The media blitz included about two dozen 30-second advertisements airing each night on prime-time network TV between June 18, 1975, and the film\\'s opening two days later.[115] Beyond that, in the description of film industry scholar Searle Kochberg, Universal \"devised and co-ordinated a highly innovative plan\" for the picture\\'s marketing.[115] As early as October 1974, Zanuck, Brown, and Benchley hit the television and radio talk show circuit to promote the paperback edition of the novel and the forthcoming film.[116] The studio and publisher Bantam agreed on a title logo that would appear on both the paperback and in all of the advertising for the film.[115] The centerpieces of the joint marketing strategy were John Williams\\'s theme and the poster image featuring the shark approaching a lone female swimmer.[56] The poster was based on the paperback\\'s cover, and had the same artist, Bantam employee Roger Kastel.[117] The Seiniger Advertising agency spent six months designing the poster; principal Tony Seiniger explained that \"no matter what we did, it didn\\'t look scary enough\". Seiniger ultimately decided that \"you had to actually go underneath the shark so you could see his teeth.\"[118]\\n', 'More merchandise was created to take advantage of the film\\'s release. In 1999, Graeme Turner wrote that Jaws was accompanied by what was \"probably the most elaborate array of tie-ins\" including \"a sound-track album, T-shirts, plastic tumblers, a book about the making of the movie, the book the movie was based on, beach towels, blankets, shark costumes, toy sharks, hobby kits, iron-on transfers, games, posters, shark\\'s tooth necklaces, sleepwear, water pistols, and more.\"[119] The Ideal Toy Company, for instance, produced a game in which the player had to use a hook to fish out items from the shark\\'s mouth before the jaws closed.[120]\\n', 'Theatrical run', 'The glowing audience response to a rough cut of the film at two test screenings in Dallas on March 26, 1975, and one in Long Beach, on March 28, along with the success of Benchley\\'s novel and the early stages of Universal\\'s marketing campaign, generated great interest among theater owners, facilitating the studio\\'s plan to debut Jaws at hundreds of cinemas simultaneously.[121][122] A third and final preview screening, of a cut incorporating changes inspired by the previous presentations, was held in Hollywood on April 24.[123] After Universal chairman Lew Wasserman attended one of the screenings, he ordered the film\\'s initial release—planned for a massive total of as many as 900 theaters—to be cut down, declaring, \"I want this picture to run all summer long. I don\\'t want people in Palm Springs to see the picture in Palm Springs. I want them to have to get in their cars and drive to see it in Hollywood.\"[124] Nonetheless, the several hundred theaters that were still booked for the opening represented what was then an unusually wide release. At the time, wide openings were associated with movies of doubtful quality; not uncommon on the grindhouse and exploitation side of the industry, they were customarily employed to diminish the effect of negative reviews and word of mouth. There had been some recent exceptions, including the rerelease of Billy Jack and the original release of its sequel The Trial of Billy Jack, the Dirty Harry sequel Magnum Force, and the latest installments in the James Bond series.[125][126] Still, the typical major studio film release at the time involved opening at a few big-city theaters, which allowed for a series of premieres. Distributors would then slowly forward prints to additional locales across the country, capitalizing on any positive critical or audience response. The outsized success of The Godfather in 1972 had sparked a trend toward wider releases, but even that film had debuted in just five theaters, before going wide in its second weekend.[127]\\n', \"On June 20, Jaws opened across North America on 464 screens—409 in the United States, the remainder in Canada.[128] The coupling of this broad distribution pattern with the movie's then even rarer national television marketing campaign yielded a release method virtually unheard-of at the time.[129] (A month earlier, Columbia Pictures had done something similar with a Charles Bronson thriller, Breakout, though that film's prospects for an extended run were much slimmer.)[130][131] Universal president Sid Sheinberg reasoned that nationwide marketing costs would be amortized at a more favorable rate per print relative to a slow, scaled release.[129][132][133] Building on the film's success, the release was subsequently expanded on July 25 to nearly 700 theaters, and on August 15 to more than 950.[134] Overseas distribution followed the same pattern, with intensive television campaigns and wide releases—in Great Britain, for instance, Jaws opened in December at more than 100 theaters.[135]\\n\", 'For its 40th anniversary, the film was released in selected theaters (across approximately 500 theaters) in the United States on Sunday, June 21, and Wednesday, June 24, 2015.[136][137]\\n', 'Another theatrical reissue was released on September 2, 2022, with the film debuting in both IMAX and RealD 3D formats, as part of the 40th anniversary celebration of another Spielberg film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. On the announcement, Travis Reed of RealD 3D remarked: \"Jaws redefined what it means to be a summer-event blockbuster and now for the first time ever audiences can experience Steven Spielberg\\'s motion picture classic in 3D ... allowing fans a completely new opportunity to immerse themselves in one of the greatest summer suspense thrillers of all time.\"[138]\\n', 'Reception', 'Box office', \"Jaws opened in 409 theaters with a record $7 million weekend[139] and grossed a record $21,116,354 in its first 10 days[140] recouping its production costs.[141] It grossed $100 million in its first 59 days from 954 playdates.[142] In just 78 days, it overtook The Godfather as the highest-grossing film at the North American box office,[127] sailing past that picture's earnings of $86 million,[143] and became the first film to earn $100 million in US theatrical rentals.[144] It spent 14 consecutive weeks as the number-one film in the United States.[145] Its initial release ultimately brought in $123.1 million in rentals.[141] Theatrical re-releases in 1976 and Summer 1979 brought its total rentals to $133.4 million.[143]\\n\", 'The film entered overseas release in December 1975,[146] and its international business mirrored its domestic performance. It broke records in Singapore,[147] New Zealand, Japan,[148] Spain,[149] and Mexico.[150] On January 11, 1976, Jaws became the highest-grossing film worldwide with rentals of $132 million, surpassing the $131 million earned by The Godfather.[151] By the time of the third film in 1983, Variety reported that it had earned worldwide rentals of $270 million.[152] Jaws was the highest-grossing film of all time until Star Wars, which debuted two years later. Star Wars surpassed Jaws for the U.S. record six months after its release and set a new global record in 1978.[153][154]\\n', 'Across all of its releases Jaws has grossed $476.5 million worldwide;[155] adjusted for inflation, it has earned almost $2 billion at 2011 prices and is the second-most successful franchise film after Star Wars.[156] Including its 2022 reissue, it has grossed $265.8 million in the United States and Canada,[155] equivalent to $1.2 billion at 2020 prices (based on an estimated 128,078,800 tickets sold),[157] making it the seventh-highest-grossing movie of all time adjusted for ticket price inflation.[158] In the United Kingdom, it is the seventh-highest-grossing film to be released since 1975, earning the equivalent of over £70 million in 2009/10 currency,[159] with admissions estimated at 16.2 million.[160] Jaws has also sold 13 million tickets in Brazil, a quantity first surpassed by Titanic in 1998, and that still ranks as the sixth most attended film in the country.[161][162]\\n', 'On television, ABC aired it for the first time on November 4, 1979, right after its theatrical re-release.[163] The first U.S. broadcast received a Nielsen rating of 39.1 and attracted 57 percent of the total audience, the second-highest televised movie audience at the time behind Gone with the Wind and the fourth-highest rated.[164][165] In the United Kingdom, 23 million people watched its inaugural broadcast in October 1981, the second-biggest British TV audience ever for a feature film behind Live and Let Die.[166]\\n', 'Critical reception', 'Jaws received mostly positive reviews upon release.[167][168] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars, calling it \"a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it\\'s populated with characters that have been developed into human beings. It\\'s a film that\\'s as frightening as The Exorcist, and yet it\\'s a nicer kind of fright, somehow more fun because we\\'re being scared by an outdoor-adventure saga instead of a brimstone-and-vomit devil.\"[169] Variety\\'s A. D. Murphy praised Spielberg\\'s directorial skills, and called Robert Shaw\\'s performance \"absolutely magnificent\".[170] According to The New Yorker\\'s Pauline Kael, it was \"the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made\\xa0... [with] more zest than an early Woody Allen picture, a lot more electricity, [and] it\\'s funny in a Woody Allen sort of way\".[171] For New Times magazine, Frank Rich wrote, \"Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days: this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen.\\xa0... It speaks well of this director\\'s gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in Jaws are those where we don\\'t even see the shark.\"[172] Writing for New York magazine, Judith Crist described the film as \"an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order\" and complimented its acting and \"extraordinary technical achievements\".[173] Rex Reed praised the \"nerve-frying\" action scenes and concluded that \"for the most part, Jaws is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department\".[174]  David Thomson wrote that \"like Coppola on The Godfather, Spielberg asserted his own role and deftly organized the elements of a roller coaster entertainment without sacrificing inner meanings. The suspense of the picture came from meticulous technique and good humor about its own surgical cutting. You have only to submit to the travesty of Jaws 2 to realize how much more engagingly Spielberg saw the ocean, the perils, the sinister beauty of the shark, and the vitality of its human opponents.\"[175]\\n', 'Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \"It\\'s a measure of how the film operates that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark\\'s victims.\\xa0... In the best films, characters are revealed in terms of the action. In movies like Jaws, characters are simply functions of the action\\xa0... like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it\\'s necessary\". He did describe it as \"the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun\".[176] Los Angeles Times critic Charles Champlin disagreed with the film\\'s PG rating, saying that \"Jaws is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age.\\xa0... It is a coarse-grained and exploitative work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written.\"[177] Marcia Magill of Films in Review said that while Jaws \"is eminently worth seeing for its second half\", she felt that before the protagonists\\' pursuit of the shark the film was \"often flawed by its busyness\".[178] William S. Pechter of Commentary described Jaws as \"a mind-numbing repast for sense-sated gluttons\" and \"filmmaking of this essentially manipulative sort\"; Molly Haskell of The Village Voice similarly characterized it as a \"scare machine that works with computer-like precision.\\xa0... You feel like a rat, being given shock therapy\".[172] The most frequently criticized aspect of the film has been the artificiality of its mechanical antagonist: Magill declared that \"the programmed shark has one truly phony close-up\",[178] and in 2002, online reviewer James Berardinelli said that if not for Spielberg\\'s deftly suspenseful direction, \"we would be doubled over with laughter at the cheesiness of the animatronic creature.\"[83] Halliwell\\'s Film Guide stated that \"despite genuinely suspenseful and frightening sequences, it is a slackly narrated and sometimes flatly handled thriller with an over-abundance of dialogue and, when it finally appears, a pretty unconvincing monster.\"[179]\\n', 'Accolades', \"Jaws won three Academy Awards, those being for Best Film Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Best Sound (Robert Hoyt, Roger Heman, Earl Madery, and John Carter).[75][180] It was also nominated for Best Picture, losing to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.[181] Spielberg greatly resented the fact that he was not nominated for Best Director.[172]\\n\", \"Along with the Oscar, John Williams's score won the Grammy Award,[182] the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music,[183] and the Golden Globe Award.[184] To her Academy Award, Verna Fields added the American Cinema Editors' Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature Film.[185] The film was voted Favorite Movie at the People's Choice Awards.[186]\\n\", \"It was also nominated for Best Film, Director, Actor (Richard Dreyfuss), Screenplay, Editing and Sound at the 29th British Academy Film Awards,[183] and Best Motion Picture–Drama, Director and Screenplay at the 33rd Golden Globe Awards.[184] Spielberg was nominated by the Directors Guild of America for the DGA Award,[187] and the Writers Guild of America nominated Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb's script for Best Adapted Drama.[188]\\n\", 'Legacy', 'In the years since its release, Jaws has frequently been cited by film critics and industry professionals as one of the greatest movies of all time.[189] It was number 48 on American Film Institute\\'s 100 Years ... 100 Movies, a list of the greatest American films of all time compiled in 1998; it dropped to number 56 on the 10th Anniversary list.[190][191] AFI also ranked the shark at number 18 on its list of the 50 Best Villains,[192] Roy Scheider\\'s line \"You\\'re gonna need a bigger boat\" 35th on a list of top 100 movie quotes,[193] Williams\\'s score at sixth on a list of 100 Years of Film Scores,[76] and the film as second on a list of 100 most thrilling films, behind only Psycho.[194] In 2003, The New York Times included the film on its list of the best 1,000 movies ever made.[195] The following year, Jaws placed at the top of the Bravo network\\'s five-hour miniseries The 100 Scariest Movie Moments.[196] The Chicago Film Critics Association named it the sixth-scariest film ever made in 2006.[197] In 2008, Jaws was ranked the fifth-greatest film in history by Empire magazine,[198] which also placed Quint at number 50 on its list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.[199] The film has been cited in many other lists of 50 and 100 greatest films, including ones compiled by Leonard Maltin,[200] Entertainment Weekly,[201] Film4,[202] Rolling Stone,[203] Total Film,[204] TV Guide,[205] and Vanity Fair.[206]\\n', 'In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, recognizing it as a landmark horror film and the first \"summer movie\".[207] In 2006, its screenplay was ranked the 63rd-best of all time by the Writers Guild of America.[208] In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed the film as the eighth best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership.[209]\\n', 'Jaws was key in establishing the benefits of a wide national release backed by heavy television advertising, rather than the traditional progressive release in which a film slowly entered new markets and built support over time.[115][127] Saturation booking, in which a film opens simultaneously at thousands of theaters, and massive media buys are now commonplace for the major Hollywood studios.[210] According to Peter Biskind, Jaws \"diminished the importance of print reviews, making it virtually impossible for a film to build slowly, finding its audience by dint of mere quality. ... Moreover, Jaws whet corporate appetites for big profits quickly, which is to say, studios wanted every film to be Jaws.\"[211] Scholar Thomas Schatz writes that it \"recalibrated the profit potential of the Hollywood hit, and redefined its status as a marketable commodity and cultural phenomenon as well. The film brought an emphatic end to Hollywood\\'s five-year recession, while ushering in an era of high-cost, high-tech, high-speed thrillers.\"[212]\\n', 'Jaws also played a major part in establishing summer as the prime season for the release of studios\\' biggest box-office contenders, their intended blockbusters;[127][213] winter had long been the time when most hoped-for hits were distributed, while summer was largely reserved for dumping films thought likely to be poor performers.[212] Jaws and Star Wars are regarded as marking the beginning of the new U.S. film industry business model dominated by \"high-concept\" pictures—with premises that can be easily described and marketed—as well as the beginning of the end of the New Hollywood period, which saw auteur films increasingly disregarded in favor of profitable big-budget pictures.[127][214] The New Hollywood era was defined by the relative autonomy filmmakers were able to attain within the major studio system; in Biskind\\'s description, \"Spielberg was the Trojan horse through which the studios began to reassert their power.\"[211]\\n', 'The film had broader cultural repercussions, as well. Similar to the way the pivotal scene in 1960\\'s Psycho made showers a new source of anxiety, Jaws led many viewers to fear going into the ocean.[215][216] Reduced beach attendance in 1975 was attributed to it,[217] as well as more reported shark sightings.[218] It is still seen as responsible for perpetuating negative stereotypes about sharks and their behavior,[219] and for producing the so-called \"Jaws effect\", which allegedly inspired \"legions of fishermen [who] piled into boats and killed thousands of the ocean predators in shark-fishing tournaments.\"[220] Benchley would later campaign to stop the depopulation of sharks, saying that \"Jaws was entirely a fiction\".[221]  Spielberg later echoed this sentiment, saying that he regretted \"the decimation of the shark population because of the book and the film\".[222][221] Conservation groups have bemoaned the fact that the film has made it considerably harder to convince the public that sharks should be protected.[223]\\n', 'Jaws set the template for many subsequent horror films, to the extent that the script for Ridley Scott\\'s 1979 science fiction film Alien was pitched to studio executives as \"Jaws in space\".[224][225] Many films based on man-eating animals, usually aquatic, were released through the 1970s and 1980s, such as Orca, Grizzly, Mako: The Jaws of Death, Barracuda, Alligator, Day of the Animals, Tintorera, and Eaten Alive. Spielberg declared Piranha, directed by Joe Dante and written by John Sayles, \"the best of the Jaws ripoffs\".[181] Among the various foreign mockbusters based on Jaws, three came from Italy: Great White,[226] which inspired a plagiarism lawsuit by Universal and was even marketed in some countries as a part of the Jaws franchise;[227] Monster Shark,[226] featured in Mystery Science Theater 3000 under the title Devil Fish;[228] and Deep Blood, which blends in a supernatural element.[229] The 1976 Brazilian film Bacalhau parodies Jaws, featuring a killer cod in place of a shark.[230][231] The 2009 Japanese horror film Psycho Shark was released in the United States as Jaws in Japan.[232] Filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki cited Jaws and Spielberg as an influence for his 2023 Japanese kaiju film Godzilla Minus One.[233]\\n', 'Richard Dreyfuss made a cameo appearance in the 2010 film Piranha 3D, a loose remake of the 1978 film.

Dreyfuss later stated that his character was a parody and a near-reincarnation of Matt Hooper, his character in Jaws.[234] During his appearance, Dreyfuss\\'s character listens to the song \"Show Me the Way to Go Home\" on the radio, which Hooper, Quint and Brody sing together aboard the Orca.\\n', 'Martha\\'s Vineyard celebrated the film\\'s 30th anniversary in 2005 with a \"JawsFest\" festival,[235] which had a second edition in 2012.[236] An independent group of fans produced the feature-length documentary The Shark Is Still Working, featuring interviews with the film\\'s cast and crew. Narrated by Roy Scheider and dedicated to Peter Benchley, who died in 2006, it debuted at the 2009 Los Angeles United Film Festival.[237][238]\\n', \"Shaw's son, Ian Shaw, co-wrote and starred as his father in the play The Shark Is Broken about the making of Jaws, which premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2019 and transferred to the West End in October 2021.[239][240]\\n\", 'On March 24, 2020, it was announced that Donna Feore will direct and choreograph Bruce, the musical retelling of the behind-the-scenes story of Jaws, with Richard Oberacker writing the musical book and lyrics and Robert Taylor working on the music. It was originally set to premiere in June 2021, but was pushed back to June 2022 at the Seattle Repertory Theatre.[241][242]\\n', 'On November 20, 2020, a replica of the shark, also called \"Bruce\", was lifted into place at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in preparation for the museum\\'s April 2021 opening. It was expected to be a major attraction. Greg Nicotero spent seven months restoring Bruce, which had been created after the original three sharks were destroyed and was on display for 15 years at Universal Studios Hollywood. Bruce then spent 25 years in a junkyard, until the owner donated the shark to the museum in 2016.[243]\\n', 'Home media', \"The first ever LaserDisc title marketed in North America was the MCA DiscoVision release of Jaws in 1978.[244] A second LaserDisc was released in 1992,[245] before a third and final version came out under MCA/Universal Home Video's Signature Collection imprint in 1995. This release was an elaborate box-set that included deleted scenes and outtakes, a new two-hour documentary on the making of the film directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau, a copy of the novel Jaws, and a CD of the soundtrack by John Williams.[246]\\n\", \"MCA Home Video first released Jaws on VHS in 1980.[247][248] For the film's 20th anniversary in 1995, MCA Universal Home Video issued a new Collector's Edition tape featuring a making-of retrospective.[249] This release sold 800,000 units in North America.[250] Another, final VHS release, marking the film's 25th anniversary in 2000, came with a companion tape containing a documentary, deleted scenes, outtakes, and a trailer.[251]\\n\", \"Jaws was first released on DVD in 2000 for the film's 25th anniversary, accompanied by a massive publicity campaign.[250] It featured a 50-minute documentary on the making of the film (an edited version of that featured on the 1995 LaserDisc release), with interviews with Spielberg, Scheider, Dreyfuss, Benchley, and other cast and crew members. Other extras included deleted scenes, outtakes, trailers, production photos, and storyboards.[252] The DVD shipped one million copies in just one month.[253] In June 2005, a 30th anniversary edition was released at the JawsFest festival on Martha's Vineyard.[235] The new DVD had many extras seen in previous home video releases, including the full two-hour Bouzereau documentary, and a previously unavailable interview with Spielberg conducted on the set of Jaws in 1974.[254] On the second JawsFest in August 2012, the Blu-ray Disc of Jaws was released,[236] with over four hours of extras, including The Shark Is Still Working.[255] The Blu-ray release was part of the celebrations of Universal's 100th anniversary, and debuted at fourth place in the charts, with over 362,000 units sold.[256] The film was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on 1 June 2020.[257]\\n\", 'Other media', 'Adaptations and merchandise', \"The film has inspired two theme park rides: one at Universal Studios Florida,[258] which closed in January 2012,[259] and one at Universal Studios Japan.[260] There is also an animatronic version of a scene from the film on the Studio Tour at Universal Studios Hollywood.[261] There have been at least two musical adaptations: JAWS The Musical!, which premiered in 2004 at the Minnesota Fringe Festival, and Giant Killer Shark: The Musical, which premiered in 2006 at the Toronto Fringe Festival.[262] Three video games based on the film were released: 1987's Jaws, developed by LJN for the Nintendo Entertainment System;[263] 2006's Jaws Unleashed by Majesco Entertainment for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and PC;[264] and 2011's Jaws: Ultimate Predator, also by Majesco, for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii.[265] A mobile game was released in 2010 for the iPhone.[266] Aristocrat made an officially licensed slot machine based on the movie.[267]\\n\", \"In 2017, video game developer Zen Studios developed and released a virtual pinball adaptation of the film as part of the Universal Classics add-on pack for the virtual pinball game Pinball FX 3.[268] This table features 3-D figures of Quint and Jaws, with the opportunity to play missions from either character's perspective.\\n\", \"The musical Bruce, based on Carl Gottlieb's book The Jaws Log, had its world premiere at the Seattle Rep theatre from May 27 to July 3, 2022.[269] The musical covers the difficulties Spielberg encountered making the movie, including the ongoing issues with the titular mechanical shark.\\n\", 'Sequels', 'Jaws spawned three sequels to declining critical favor and commercial performance. Their combined domestic grosses amount to barely half of the first film\\'s.[270] In October 1975, Spielberg declared to a film festival audience that \"making a sequel to anything is just a cheap carny trick\".[181] Nonetheless, he did consider taking on the first sequel when its original director, John D. Hancock, was fired a few days into the shoot; ultimately, his obligations to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which he was working on with Dreyfuss, made it impossible.[271] Jaws 2 (1978) was eventually directed by Jeannot Szwarc, with Scheider, Gary, Hamilton, and Jeffrey Kramer reprising their roles. It is generally regarded as the best of the sequels.[272]\\n', 'Jaws 3-D (1983) does not feature any of the original actors, although it was directed by Joe Alves, who had served as art director and production designer, respectively, on the two preceding films.[273] Starring Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr., it was released to heavily negative reviews in 3D format. The effect did not transfer to television or home video, where it was renamed Jaws 3.[274] Jaws: The Revenge (1987) was directed by Joseph Sargent, co-starred Michael Caine, and featured the return of Lorraine Gary as Ellen Brody. Entertainment Weekly listed it among the worst sequels ever made.[275]\\n', 'While all three sequels made a profit at the box office (Jaws 2 and Jaws 3-D were among the top 20 highest-grossing films of their respective years), critics and audiences alike were largely dissatisfied with the films.[276]\\n', 'See also', 'References', '\\n^ a b \"Jaws (1975)\".

In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon\\'s lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.[87] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors.[88] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm.

They continue to use their own national currencies, although all but Denmark are obliged to join once they meet the euro convergence criteria.[9]\\n', 'Among non-EU member states, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City have formal agreements with the EU to use the euro as their official currency and issue their own coins.[10][11][12] In addition, Kosovo and Montenegro have adopted the euro unilaterally, relying on euros already in circulation rather than minting currencies of their own.[13] These six countries, however, have no representation in any eurozone institution.[14]\\n', 'The Eurosystem is the monetary authority of the eurozone, the Eurogroup is an informal body of finance ministers that makes fiscal policy for the currency union, and the European System of Central Banks is responsible for fiscal and monetary cooperation between eurozone and non-eurozone EU members. The European Central Bank (ECB) makes monetary policy for the eurozone, sets its base interest rate, and issues euro banknotes and coins.\\n', \"Since the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the eurozone has established and used provisions for granting emergency loans to member states in return for enacting economic reforms.[citation needed] The eurozone has also enacted some limited fiscal integration; for example, in peer review of each other's national budgets. The issue is political and in a state of flux in terms of what further provisions will be agreed for eurozone change. No eurozone member state has left, and there are no provisions to do so or to be expelled.[15]\\n\", 'Territory[edit]', 'Eurozone[edit]', 'In 1998, eleven member states of the European Union had met the euro convergence criteria, and the eurozone came into existence with the official launch of the euro (alongside national currencies) on 1 January 1999 in those countries: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Greece qualified in 2000 and was admitted on 1 January 2001.\\n', 'These twelve founding members introduced physical euro banknotes and euro coins on 1 January 2002.

The Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark was once pegged to the Deutsche mark at par, and continues to be pegged to the euro today at the Deutsche mark's old rate (1.95583 per euro). The Bulgarian lev was initially pegged to the Deutsche Mark at a rate of BGL 1000 to DEM 1 in 1997, and has been pegged at a rate of BGN 1.95583 to EUR 1 since the introduction of the euro and the redenomination of the lev in 1999. The West African and Central African CFA francs are pegged exactly at 655.957\\xa0CFA to 1\\xa0EUR. In 1998, in anticipation of Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union, the Council of the European Union addressed the monetary agreements France had with the CFA Zone and Comoros, and ruled that the ECB had no obligation towards the convertibility of the CFA and Comorian francs. The responsibility of the free convertibility remained in the French Treasury.\\n\", 'Without formal agreement[edit]', 'Kosovo and Montenegro unilaterally adopted the euro as their sole currency without an agreement and, therefore, have no issuing rights.[29] These states are not considered part of the eurozone by the ECB. However, sometimes the term eurozone is applied to all territories that have adopted the euro as their sole currency.[30][31][32] Further unilateral adoption of the euro (euroisation), by both non-euro EU and non-EU members, is opposed by the ECB and EU.[33]\\n', 'Historical eurozone enlargements and exchange-rate regimes for EU members[edit]', 'The chart below provides a full summary of all applying exchange-rate regimes for EU members, since the birth, on 13 March 1979, of the European Monetary System with its Exchange Rate Mechanism and the related new common currency ECU. On 1 January 1999, the euro replaced the ECU\\xa01:1 at the exchange rate markets. During 1979–1999, the Deutsche Mark functioned as a de facto anchor for the ECU, meaning there was only a minor difference between pegging a currency against the ECU and pegging it against the Deutsche Mark.\\n', 'Sources: EC convergence reports 1996-2014, Italian lira, Spanish peseta, Portuguese escudo, Finnish markka, Greek drachma, Sterling\\n', 'The eurozone was born with its first 11\\xa0member states on 1 January 1999. The first enlargement of the eurozone, to Greece, took place on 1 January 2001, one year before the euro physically entered into circulation. The next enlargements were to states which joined the EU in 2004, and then joined the eurozone on 1 January of the year noted: Slovenia in 2007, Cyprus in 2008, Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014, and Lithuania in 2015. Croatia, which acceded to the EU in 2013, adopted the euro in 2023.\\n', 'All new EU members joining the bloc after the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 are obliged to adopt the euro under the terms of their accession treaties. However, the last of the five economic convergence criteria which need first to be complied with in order to qualify for euro adoption, is the exchange rate stability criterion, which requires having been an ERM-member for a minimum of two years without the presence of \"severe tensions\" for the currency exchange rate.\\n', 'In September 2011, a diplomatic source close to the euro adoption preparation talks with the seven remaining new member states who had yet to adopt the euro at that time (Bulgaria, Czechia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania), claimed that the monetary union (eurozone) they had thought they were going to join upon their signing of the accession treaty may very well end up being a very different union, entailing a much closer fiscal, economic, and political convergence than originally anticipated. This changed legal status of the eurozone could potentially cause them to conclude that the conditions for their promise to join were no longer valid, which \"could force them to stage new referendums\" on euro adoption.[34]\\n', 'Future enlargement[edit]', 'Seven countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Sweden) are EU members but do not use the euro.\\n', 'Before joining the eurozone, a state must spend at least two years in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM\\xa0II). As of January\\xa02023[update], the Danish central bank and the Bulgarian central bank participate in ERM\\xa0II.\\n', 'Denmark obtained a special opt-out in the original Maastricht Treaty, and thus is legally exempt from joining the eurozone unless its government decides otherwise, either by parliamentary vote or referendum. The United Kingdom likewise had an opt-out prior to withdrawing from the EU in 2020.\\n', 'The remaining six countries are obliged to adopt the euro in future, although the EU has so far not tried to enforce any time plan. They should join as soon as they fulfill the convergence criteria, which include being part of ERM\\xa0II for two years. Sweden, which joined the EU in 1995 after the Maastricht Treaty was signed, is required to join the eurozone. However, the Swedish people turned down euro adoption in a 2003 referendum and since then the country has intentionally avoided fulfilling the adoption requirements by not joining ERM\\xa0II, which is voluntary.[35][36] Bulgaria joined ERM\\xa0II on 10 July 2020.[37]\\n', 'Interest in joining the eurozone increased in Denmark, and initially in Poland, as a result of the financial crisis of 2007–2008. In Iceland, there was an increase in interest in joining the European Union, a pre-condition for adopting the euro.[38] However, by 2010 the debt crisis in the eurozone caused interest from Poland, as well as the Czech Republic, Denmark and Sweden to cool.[39]\\n', 'Expulsion and withdrawal[edit]', 'In the opinion of journalist Leigh Phillips and Locke Lord\\'s Charles Proctor,[40][41] there is no provision in any European Union treaty for an exit from the eurozone. In fact, they argued, the Treaties make it clear that the process of monetary union was intended to be \"irreversible\" and \"irrevocable\".[41] However, in 2009, a European Central Bank legal study argued that, while voluntary withdrawal is legally not possible, expulsion remains \"conceivable\".[42] Although an explicit provision for an exit option does not exist, many experts and politicians in Europe have suggested an option to leave the eurozone should be included in the relevant treaties.[43]\\n', 'On the issue of leaving the eurozone, the European Commission has stated that \"[t]he irrevocability of membership in the euro area is an integral part of the Treaty framework and the Commission, as a guardian of the EU Treaties, intends to fully respect [that irrevocability].\"[44] It added that it \"does not intend to propose [any] amendment\" to the relevant Treaties, the current status being \"the best way going forward to increase the resilience of euro area Member States to potential economic and financial crises.[44] The European Central Bank, responding to a question by a Member of the European Parliament, has stated that an exit is not allowed under the Treaties.[45]\\n', 'Likewise there is no provision for a state to be expelled from the euro.[46] Some, however, including the Dutch government, favour the creation of an expulsion provision for the case whereby a heavily indebted state in the eurozone refuses to comply with an EU economic reform policy.[47]\\n', 'In a Texas law journal, University of Texas at Austin law professor Jens Dammann has argued that even now EU law contains an implicit right for member states to leave the eurozone if they no longer meet the criteria that they had to meet in order to join it.[48] Furthermore, he has suggested that, under narrow circumstances, the European Union can expel member states from the eurozone.[49]\\n', 'Administration and representation[edit]', 'The monetary policy of all countries in the eurozone is managed by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Eurosystem which comprises the ECB and the central banks of the EU states who have joined the eurozone. Countries outside the eurozone are not represented in these institutions. Whereas all EU member states are part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), non EU member states have no say in all three institutions, even those with monetary agreements such as Monaco. The ECB is entitled to authorise the design and printing of euro banknotes and the volume of euro coins minted, and its president is currently Christine Lagarde.\\n', 'The eurozone is represented politically by its finance ministers, known collectively as the Eurogroup, and is presided over by a president, currently Paschal Donohoe. The finance ministers of the EU member states that use the euro meet a day before a meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) of the Council of the European Union. The Group is not an official Council formation but when the full EcoFin council votes on matters only affecting the eurozone, only Euro Group members are permitted to vote on it.[50][51][52]\\n', \"Since the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, the Euro Group has met irregularly not as finance ministers, but as heads of state and government (like the European Council). It is in this forum, the Euro summit, that many eurozone reforms have been decided upon. In 2011, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy pushed for these summits to become regular and twice a year in order for it to be a 'true economic government'.[citation needed]\\n\", 'Reform[edit]', 'In April 2008 in Brussels, future European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker suggested that the eurozone should be represented at the IMF as a bloc, rather than each member state separately: \"It is absurd for those 15 countries not to agree to have a single representation at the IMF. It makes us look absolutely ridiculous. We are regarded as buffoons on the international scene\".[53] In 2017 Juncker stated that he aims to have this agreed by the end of his mandate in 2019.[54] However, Finance Commissioner Joaquín Almunia stated that before there is common representation, a common political agenda should be agreed upon.[53]\\n', 'Leading EU figures including the commission and national governments have proposed a variety of reforms to the eurozone\\'s architecture; notably the creation of a Finance Minister, a larger eurozone budget, and reform of the current bailout mechanisms into either a \"European Monetary Fund\" or a eurozone Treasury. While many have similar themes, details vary greatly.[55][56][57][58]\\n', 'Economy[edit]', 'Comparison table[edit]', 'The 20 largest economies in the world including eurozone as a single entity, by nominal GDP (2020) at their peak level of GDP in billions US$.

Between June 2000 and October 2008, the main refinancing operations were variable rate tenders, as opposed to fixed rate tenders. The figures indicated in the table from 2000 to 2008 refer to the minimum interest rate at which counterparties may place their bids.[4]\\n', '\\n', 'Public debt[edit]', 'The following table states the ratio of public debt to GDP in percent for eurozone countries given by EuroStat.[63] The euro convergence criterion is to not exceed 60%.\\n', 'Fiscal policies[edit]', 'The primary means for fiscal coordination within the EU lies in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines which are written for every member state, but with particular reference to the 20 current members of the eurozone. These guidelines are not binding, but are intended to represent policy coordination among the EU member states, so as to take into account the linked structures of their economies.\\n', 'For their mutual assurance and stability of the currency, members of the eurozone have to respect the Stability and Growth Pact, which sets agreed limits on deficits and national debt, with associated sanctions for deviation. The Pact originally set a limit of 3% of GDP for the yearly deficit of all eurozone member states; with fines for any state which exceeded this amount. In 2005, Portugal, Germany, and France had all exceeded this amount, but the Council of Ministers had not voted to fine those states. Subsequently, reforms were adopted to provide more flexibility and ensure that the deficit criteria took into account the economic conditions of the member states, and additional factors.\\n', 'The Fiscal Compact[66][67] (formally, the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union),[68] is an intergovernmental treaty introduced as a new stricter version of the Stability and Growth Pact, signed on 2 March 2012 by all member states of the European Union (EU), except the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom,[69] and Croatia (subsequently acceding the EU in July 2013). The treaty entered into force on 1 January 2013 for the 16 states which completed ratification prior of this date.[70] As of 1 April 2014, it had been ratified and entered into force for all 25 signatories.\\n', 'Olivier Blanchard suggests that a fiscal union in the eurozone can mitigate devastating effects of the single currency on the eurozone peripheral countries. But he adds that the currency bloc will not work perfectly even if a fiscal transfer system is built, because, he argues, the fundamental issue about competitiveness adjustment is not tackled. The problem is, since the eurozone peripheral countries do not have their own currencies, they are forced to adjust their economies by decreasing their wages instead of devaluation.[71]\\n', 'Bailout provisions[edit]', \"The financial crisis of 2007–2008 prompted a number of reforms in the eurozone. One was a U-turn on the eurozone's bailout policy that led to the creation of a specific fund to assist eurozone states in trouble. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) were created in 2010 to provide, alongside the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a system and fund to bail out members. However, the EFSF and EFSM were temporary, small and lacked a basis in the EU treaties. Therefore, it was agreed in 2011 to establish a European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which would be much larger, funded only by eurozone states (not the EU as a whole as the EFSF/EFSM were) and would have a permanent treaty basis. As a result of that its creation involved agreeing an amendment to TEFU Article\\xa0136 allowing for the ESM and a new ESM treaty to detail how the ESM would operate. If both are successfully ratified according to schedule, the ESM would be operational by the time the EFSF/EFSM expire in mid-2013.\\n\", 'In February 2016, the UK secured further confirmation that countries that do not use the Euro would not be required to contribute to bailouts for eurozone countries.[72]\\n', 'Peer review[edit]', \"In June 2010, a broad agreement was finally reached on a controversial proposal for member states to peer review each other's budgets prior to their presentation to national parliaments. Although showing the entire budget to each other was opposed by Germany, Sweden and the UK, each government would present to their peers and the Commission their estimates for growth, inflation, revenue and expenditure levels six months before they go to national parliaments. If a country was to run a deficit, they would have to justify it to the rest of the EU while countries with a debt more than 60% of GDP would face greater scrutiny.[73]\\n\", \"The plans would apply to all EU members, not just the eurozone, and have to be approved by EU leaders along with proposals for states to face sanctions before they reach the 3% limit in the Stability and Growth Pact. Poland has criticised the idea of withholding regional funding for those who break the deficit limits, as that would only impact the poorer states.[73] In June 2010 France agreed to back Germany's plan for suspending the voting rights of members who breach the rules.[74] In March 2011 was initiated a new reform of the Stability and Growth Pact aiming at straightening the rules by adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the deficit or the debt rules.[75][76]\\n\", 'Criticism[edit]', 'In 1997, Arnulf Baring expressed concern that the European Monetary Union would make Germans the most hated people in Europe. Baring suspected the possibility that the people in Mediterranean countries would regard Germans and the currency bloc as economic policemen.[77]\\n', \"In 2001, James Tobin thought that the euro project would not succeed without making drastic changes to European institutions, pointing out the difference between the US and the eurozone.[78] Concerning monetary policies, the system of Federal Reserve banks in the US aims at both growth and reducing unemployment, while the ECB tends to give its first priority to price stability under the Bundesbank's supervision. As the price level of the currency bloc is kept low, the unemployment level of the region has become higher than that of the US since 1982.[78] Concerning fiscal policies, 12% of the US federal budget is used for transfers to states and local governments. The US government does not impose restrictions on state budget policies, whereas the Treaty of Maastricht requires each eurozone member country to keep its budget deficit below 3% of its GDP.[78]\\n\", 'In 2008, a study by Alberto Alesina and Vincenzo Galasso found that the adoption of euro promoted market deregulation and market liberalization.[79][80] Furthermore, the euro was also linked to wage moderation, as wage growth slowed down in countries that adopted the new currency.[79] Oliver Hart, who received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2016, criticized the euro, calling it a \"mistake\" and emphasising his opposition to monetary union since its inception.[81] He also expressed opposition to European integration, arguing that the European Union should instead focus on decentralisation as it has “gone too far in centralising power”.[81] In 2018, a study based on DiD methodology found that the adoption of euro produced no systematic growth effects, as no growth-enhancing effects were found when compared to European economies outside the eurozone.[82]\\n', 'The eurozone has also been criticized for deepening inequality in Europe, particularly between the richest and poorest countries.[83] According to a study by Bertelsmann Stiftung, countries such as Austria and the Netherlands benefited significantly from the common currency, while southern and eastern European members of the eurozone gained very little,[84] and some countries are considered to have suffered adverse effects from adopting the euro.[85] In an article for the Politico, Joseph Stiglitz argues: \"The result for the eurozone has been slower growth, and especially for the weaker countries within it. The euro was supposed to usher in greater prosperity, which in turn would lead to renewed commitment to European integration. It has done just the opposite — increasing divisions within the EU, especially between creditor and debtor countries.\"[85] Matthias Matthijs believes that the euro resulted in a \"winner-take-all\" economy, as national income differences between eurozone members have widened further.[86] He argues that countries such as Austria and Germany have gained from the eurozone at the expense of southern countries like Italy and Spain.[86]\\n', 'By adopting the euro and abandoning their national currencies, eurozone countries gave up their ability to conduct independent monetary policy; as such, monetary policies used to combat recession, such as monetary stimulus or currency devaluation, are no longer available.[86] During the European debt crisis, several eurozone countries (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Cyprus) were unable to repay their debt without third-party intervention by the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.[87] In order to grant the bailout, the ECB and the IMF forced the affected countries to adopt strict austerity measures.[86] The European bailouts were largely about shifting exposure from banks onto European taxpayers,[88][89][90] and exacerbated issues such as high unemployment and poverty.[91][92]\\n', \"In 2019, a study from the Centre for European Policy concluded that while some countries had gained from adopting the euro, several countries were poorer than they would have been had they not adopted it, with France and Italy being particularly affected.[93][94] The publication prompted a large number of reactions, pushing its authors to put out a statement clarifying some points.[95] In 2020, a study from the University of Bonn reached a different conclusion: the adoption of the euro made “some mild losers (France, Germany, Italy, and Portugal) and a clear winner (Ireland)”.[96] Both studies used the synthetic control method to estimate what might have happened if the euro hadn't been adopted.\\n\", 'See also[edit]', 'Notes[edit]', '\\n^ The self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is not recognised by the EU and uses the Turkish lira.

      "['From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia', 'Contents', 'Ringo Starr', '\\n', 'Sir Richard Starkey[2] MBE[3] (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, songwriter and actor who achieved international fame as the drummer for the Beatles. Starr occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \"Yellow Submarine\" and \"With a Little Help from My Friends\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles songs \"Don\\'t Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus\\'s Garden\", and is credited as a co-writer of four others. \\n', 'Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, with periods of prolonged hospitalisation. As a teenager Starr became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll around early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes when he was asked to join the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. \\n', 'In addition to the Beatles\\' films, Starr has acted in numerous others. After the Beatles disbanded, he released several successful singles including the US top-ten hit \"It Don\\'t Come Easy\", and number ones \"Photograph\" and \"You\\'re Sixteen\". His most successful UK single was \"Back Off Boogaloo\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. Starr has also featured in numerous documentaries, hosted television shows, narrated the first two series of the children\\'s television programme Thomas & Friends and portrayed \"Mr. Conductor\" during the first season of the PBS children\\'s television series Shining Time Station. Since 1989, he has toured with thirteen variations of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band.\\n', 'Starr\\'s playing style, which emphasised feel over technical virtuosity, influenced many drummers to reconsider their playing from a compositional perspective. He also influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings.[4] In his opinion, his finest recorded performance was on the Beatles\\' \"Rain\".[5] In 1999, he was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame.[6] In 2011, Rolling Stone readers named him the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. He was inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a Beatle in 1988 and as a solo artist in 2015,[7] and appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music.[8]\\n', 'Early life', 'Richard Starkey was born on 7 July 1940 at 9 Madryn Street in Dingle, an inner-city area of Liverpool. He is the only child of confectioners Richard Starkey (1913–1981) and Elsie Gleave (1914–1987).[9] Elsie enjoyed singing and dancing, a hobby that she shared with her husband, an avid fan of swing.[10] Prior to the birth of their son, whom they called \"Ritchie\", the couple had spent much of their free time on the local ballroom circuit, but their regular outings ended soon after his birth.[11] Elsie adopted an overprotective approach to raising her son that bordered on fixation. Subsequently, \"Big Ritchie\", as Starkey\\'s father became known, lost interest in his family, choosing instead to spend long hours drinking and dancing in pubs, sometimes for several consecutive days.[11]\\n', 'In an effort to reduce their housing costs, his family moved in 1944 to another neighbourhood in the Dingle, Admiral Grove; soon afterwards his parents separated, and they divorced within the year.[12] Starkey later stated that he has \"no real memories\" of his father, who made little effort to bond with him, visiting as few as three times thereafter.[13] Elsie found it difficult to survive on her ex-husband\\'s support payments of thirty shillings a week, so she took on several menial jobs cleaning houses before securing a position as a barmaid, an occupation that she held for twelve years.[14]\\n', 'At the age of six, Starkey developed appendicitis. Following a routine appendectomy he contracted peritonitis, causing him to fall into a coma that lasted days.[15] His recovery spanned twelve months, which he spent away from his family at Liverpool\\'s Myrtle Street children\\'s hospital.[16] Upon his discharge in May 1948, his mother allowed him to stay at home, causing him to miss school.[17] At age eight, he remained illiterate, with a poor grasp of mathematics.[17] His lack of education contributed to a feeling of alienation at school, which resulted in his regularly playing truant at Sefton Park.[18] After several years of twice-weekly tutoring from his surrogate sister and neighbour, Marie Maguire Crawford, Starkey had nearly caught up to his peers academically, but in 1953, he contracted tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium, where he remained for two years.[19] During his stay the medical staff made an effort to stimulate motor activity and relieve boredom by encouraging their patients to join the hospital band, leading to his first exposure to a percussion instrument: a makeshift mallet made from a cotton bobbin that he used to strike the cabinets next to his bed.[20] Soon afterwards, he grew increasingly interested in drumming, receiving a copy of the Alyn Ainsworth song \"Bedtime for Drums\" as a convalescence gift from Crawford.[21] Starkey commented: \"I was in the hospital band ... That\\'s where I really started playing. I never wanted anything else from there on ... My grandparents gave me a mandolin and a banjo, but I didn\\'t want them. My grandfather gave me a harmonica ... we had a piano – nothing. Only the drums.\"[22]\\n', 'Starkey attended St Silas, a Church of England primary school near his house where his classmates nicknamed him \"Lazarus\", and later Dingle Vale Secondary modern school, where he showed an aptitude for art and drama, as well as practical subjects including mechanics.[23] As a result of the prolonged hospitalisations, he fell behind his peers scholastically and was ineligible for the 11-plus qualifying examination required for attendance at a grammar school.[24] On 17 April 1954, Starkey\\'s mother married Harry Graves at the register office on Mount Pleasant, Liverpool.[25] He was an ex-Londoner who had moved to Liverpool following the failure of his first marriage. Graves, an impassioned fan of big band music and their vocalists, introduced Starkey to recordings by Dinah Shore, Sarah Vaughan and Billy Daniels.[26] Graves stated that he and \"Ritchie\" never had an unpleasant exchange between them; Starkey later commented: \"He was great ... I learned gentleness from Harry.\"[27] After the extended hospital stay following Starkey\\'s recovery from tuberculosis, he did not return to school, preferring instead to stay at home and listen to music while playing along by beating biscuit tins with sticks.[28]\\n', 'Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described Starkey\\'s upbringing as \"a Dickensian chronicle of misfortune\".[29] Houses in the area were \"poorly ventilated, postage-stamp-sized ... patched together by crumbling plaster walls, with a rear door that opened onto an outhouse.\"[29] Crawford commented: \"Like all of the families who lived in the Dingle, he was part of an ongoing struggle to survive.\"[29] The children who lived there spent much of their time at Prince\\'s Park, escaping the soot-filled air of their coal-fuelled neighbourhood.[29] Adding to their difficult circumstances, violent crime was an almost constant concern for people living in one of the oldest and poorest inner-city districts in Liverpool.[30] Starkey later commented: \"You kept your head down, your eyes open, and you didn\\'t get in anybody\\'s way.\"[31]\\n', \"After his return home from the sanatorium in late 1955, Starkey entered the workforce but was lacking in motivation and discipline; his initial attempts at gainful employment proved unsuccessful.[32] In an effort to secure himself some warm clothes, he briefly held a railway worker's job with British Rail, which came with an employer-issued suit. He was supplied with a hat but no uniform and, unable to pass the physical examination, he was laid off and granted unemployment benefits.[33] He then found work as a waiter serving drinks on a day boat that travelled from Liverpool to North Wales, but his fear of conscription into military service led him to quit the job, not wanting to give the Royal Navy the impression that he was suitable for seafaring work.[34] In mid-1956, Graves secured Starkey a position as an apprentice machinist at Henry Hunt and Son, a Liverpool school equipment manufacturer.[35] While working at the facility Starkey befriended Roy Trafford, and the two bonded over their shared interest in music.[36] Trafford introduced Starkey to skiffle, and he quickly became a fervent admirer.[36]\\n\", 'Career', 'First bands', 'Soon after Trafford piqued Starkey\\'s interest in skiffle, the two began rehearsing songs in the manufacturing plant\\'s cellar during their lunch breaks. Trafford recalled: \"I played a guitar, and [Ritchie] just made a noise on a box ... Sometimes, he just slapped a biscuit tin with some keys, or banged on the backs of chairs.\"[36] The pair were joined by Starkey\\'s neighbour and co-worker, the guitarist Eddie Miles, forming the Eddie Miles Band, later renamed Eddie Clayton and the Clayton Squares after a Liverpool landmark.[37] The band performed popular skiffle songs such as \"Rock Island Line\" and \"Walking Cane\", with Starkey raking a thimble across a washboard, creating primitive, driving rhythms.[38] Starkey enjoyed dancing as his parents had years earlier, and he and Trafford briefly took dance lessons at two schools. Though the lessons were short-lived, they provided Starkey and Trafford with an introduction that allowed them to dance competently while enjoying nights out on the town.[38]\\n', 'On Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a second-hand drum kit consisting of a snare drum, bass drum and a makeshift cymbal fashioned from a rubbish bin lid. Although basic and crude, the kit facilitated his progression as a musician while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band, who went on to book prestigious local gigs before the skiffle craze faded in early 1958 as American rock and roll became popular in the UK.[39]\\n', \"In November 1959, Starkey joined Al Caldwell's Texans, a skiffle group who were looking for someone with a proper drum kit so that the group could transition from one of Liverpool's best-known skiffle acts to a full-fledged rock and roll band.[40][nb 1] They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes shortly before recruiting Starkey.[42] About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr; derived from the rings he wore and also because it implied a country and western influence. His singing solos were billed as Starr Time.[43]\\n\", 'By early 1960, the Hurricanes had become one of Liverpool\\'s leading bands.[44] In May, they were offered a three-month residency at a Butlins holiday camp in Wales.[45] Although initially reluctant to accept the residency and end his five-year machinist apprenticeship that he had begun four years earlier, Starr eventually agreed to the arrangement.[46] The Butlins gig led to other opportunities for the band, including an unpleasant tour of US Air Force bases in France about which Starr commented: \"The French don\\'t like the British; at least I didn\\'t like them.\"[47] The Hurricanes became so successful that when initially offered a highly coveted residency in Hamburg, they turned it down because of their prior commitment with Butlins.[48] They eventually accepted, joining the Beatles at Bruno Koschmider\\'s Kaiserkeller on 1 October 1960, where Starr first met the band.[49] Storm\\'s Hurricanes were given top-billing over the Beatles, who also received less pay.[50] Starr performed with the Beatles during a few stand-in engagements while in Hamburg. On 15 October 1960, he drummed with John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison, recording with them for the first time while backing Hurricanes singer Lu Walters on the George Gershwin/DuBose Heyward aria \"Summertime\".[51][nb 2] During Starr\\'s first stay in Hamburg he also met Tony Sheridan, who valued his drumming abilities to the point of asking Starr to leave the Hurricanes and join his band.[53]\\n', 'The Beatles', 'Replacing Best', 'Starr quit Rory Storm and the Hurricanes in January 1962 and briefly joined Sheridan in Hamburg before returning to the Hurricanes for a third season at Butlins.[54][nb 3] On 14 August, Starr accepted Lennon\\'s invitation to join the Beatles.[56] On 16 August, Beatles manager Brian Epstein fired their drummer, Pete Best, who recalled: \"He said \\'I\\'ve got some bad news for you. The boys want you out and Ringo in.\\' He said [Beatles producer] George Martin wasn\\'t too pleased with my playing [and] the boys thought I didn\\'t fit in.\"[57] Starr first performed as a member of the Beatles on 18 August 1962, at a horticultural society dance at Port Sunlight.[58] After his appearance at the Cavern Club the following day, Best fans, upset by his firing, held vigils outside his house and at the club shouting \"Pete forever! Ringo never!\"[55] Harrison received a black eye from one upset fan, and Epstein, whose car tyres they had flattened in anger, temporarily hired a bodyguard.[59]\\n', 'Starr\\'s first recording session as a member of the Beatles took place on 4 September 1962.[56] He stated that Martin had thought that he \"was crazy and couldn\\'t play ... because I was trying to play the percussion and the drums at the same time, we were just a four-piece band\".[60] For their second recording session with Starr, on 11 September 1962, Martin replaced him with session drummer Andy White while recording takes for what would be the two sides of the Beatles\\' first single, \"Love Me Do\", backed with \"P.S. I Love You\".[61] Starr played tambourine on \"Love Me Do\" and maracas on \"P.S. I Love You\".[56][62] Concerned about his status in the Beatles, he thought: \"That\\'s the end, they\\'re doing a Pete Best on me.\"[63] Martin later clarified: \"I simply didn\\'t know what Ringo was like and I wasn\\'t prepared to take any risks.\"[64][nb 4]\\n', 'By November 1962, Starr had been accepted by Beatles fans, who were now calling for him to sing.[65] He began receiving an amount of fan mail equal to that of the others, which helped to secure his position within the band.[66] Starr considered himself fortunate to be on the same \"wavelength\" as the other Beatles: \"I had to be, or I wouldn\\'t have lasted. I had to join them as people as well as a drummer.\"[67] He was given a small percentage of Lennon and McCartney\\'s publishing company, Northern Songs, but derived his primary income during this period from a one-quarter share of Beatles Ltd, a corporation financed by the band\\'s net concert earnings.[66] He commented on the nature of his lifestyle after having achieved success with the Beatles: \"I lived in nightclubs for three years. It used to be a non-stop party.\"[68] Like his father, Starr became well known for his late-night dancing and he received praise for his skills.[68]\\n', 'Worldwide success', 'During 1963, the Beatles enjoyed increasing popularity in Britain. In January, their second single, \"Please Please Me\", followed \"Love Me Do\" into the UK charts and a successful television appearance on Thank Your Lucky Stars earned favourable reviews, leading to a boost in sales and radio play.[69] By the end of the year, the phenomenon known as Beatlemania had spread throughout the country, and by February 1964 the Beatles had become an international success when they performed in New York City on The Ed Sullivan Show to a record 73\\xa0million viewers.[70] Starr commented: \"In the States I know I went over well. It knocked me out to see and hear the kids waving for me. I\\'d made it as a personality ... Our appeal ... is that we\\'re ordinary lads.\"[71] He was a source of inspiration for several songs written at the time, including Penny Valentine\\'s \"I Want to Kiss Ringo Goodbye\" and Rolf Harris\\'s \"Ringo for President\".[72] Cher released her first single, \"Ringo, I Love You\" in 1964 under the pseudonym Bonnie Joe Mason.\\n', 'In 1964, \"I love Ringo\" lapel pins were the bestselling Beatles merchandise.[72] The prominent placing of the Ludwig logo on the bass drum of his American import drum kit gave the company such a burst of publicity that it became the dominant drum manufacturer in North America for the next twenty years.[73] During live performances, the Beatles continued the \"Starr Time\" routine that had been popular among his fans: Lennon would place a microphone in front of Starr\\'s kit in preparation for his spotlight moment and audiences would erupt in screams.[74] When the Beatles made their film debut in A Hard Day\\'s Night, Starr garnered praise from critics, who considered his delivery of deadpan one-liners and his non-speaking scenes highlights.[75] The extended non-speaking sequences had to be arranged by director Richard Lester because of Starr\\'s lack of sleep the previous night; Starr commented: \"Because I\\'d been drinking all night I was incapable of saying a line.\"[76] Epstein attributed Starr\\'s acclaim to \"the little man\\'s quaintness\".[77] After the release of the Beatles\\' second feature film, Help! (1965), Starr won a Melody Maker poll against his fellow Beatles for his performance as the central character in the film.[78]\\n', 'During an interview with Playboy in 1964, Lennon explained that Starr had filled in with the Beatles when Best was ill; Starr replied: \"[Best] took little pills to make him ill\".[79] Soon after, Best filed a libel suit against him that lasted four years before the court reached an undisclosed settlement in Best\\'s favour.[80] In June, the Beatles were scheduled to tour Denmark, the Netherlands, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Before the start of the tour,[81] Starr was stricken with a high-grade fever, pharyngitis and tonsillitis, and briefly stayed in a local hospital, followed by several days of recuperation at home.[82] He was temporarily replaced for five concerts by 24-year-old session drummer Jimmie Nicol.[83] Starr was discharged from the hospital and rejoined the band in Melbourne on 15 June.[84][nb 5] He later said that he feared he would be permanently replaced during his illness.[87] In August, the Beatles were introduced to American songwriter Bob Dylan, who offered the group cannabis cigarettes. Starr was the first to try one but the others were hesitant.[88]\\n', 'On 11 February 1965, Starr married Maureen Cox, whom he had met in 1962.[89] By this time the stress and pressure of Beatlemania had reached a peak for him. He received a telephoned death threat before a show in Montreal, and resorted to positioning his cymbals vertically in an attempt to defend against would-be assassins. The constant pressure affected the Beatles\\' performances; Starr commented: \"We were turning into such bad musicians ... there was no groove to it.\"[90] He was also feeling increasingly isolated from the musical activities of his bandmates, who were moving past the traditional boundaries of rock music into territory that often did not require his accompaniment; during recording sessions he spent hours playing cards with their road manager Neil Aspinall and road manager Mal Evans while the other Beatles perfected tracks without him.[91] In a letter published in Melody Maker, a fan asked the Beatles to let Starr sing more; he replied: \"[I am] quite happy with my one little track on each album\".[91]\\n', 'Studio years', 'In August 1966, the Beatles released Revolver, their seventh UK LP.[92] It included the song \"Yellow Submarine\", their only British number-one single with Starr as the lead singer.[93] Later that month, owing to the increasing pressures of touring, the Beatles gave their final concert, a 30-minute performance at San Francisco\\'s Candlestick Park.[94] Starr commented: \"We gave up touring at the right time. Four years of Beatlemania were enough for anyone.\"[95] By December he had moved to a larger estate called Sunny Heights, 3 acres (1.2\\xa0ha) in size, at St George\\'s Hill in Weybridge, Surrey, near to Lennon.[96] Although he had equipped the house with many luxury items, including numerous televisions, light machines, film projectors, stereo equipment, a billiard table, go-kart track and a bar named the Flying Cow, he did not include a drum kit; he explained: \"When we don\\'t record, I don\\'t play.\"[97]\\n', 'For the Beatles\\' seminal 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band, Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon–McCartney composition \"With a Little Help from My Friends\".[98] Although the Beatles had enjoyed widespread commercial and critical success with Sgt. Pepper, the long hours they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr\\'s increased feeling of alienation within the band; he commented: \"[It] wasn\\'t our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, but for me it was a bit like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play.\"[99][nb 6] His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison.[101] During his downtime, Starr worked on his guitar playing, and said: \"I jump into chords that no one seems to get into. Most of the stuff I write is twelve-bar\".[102]\\n', 'Epstein\\'s death in August 1967 left the Beatles without management; Starr remarked: \"[It was] a strange time for us, when it\\'s someone who we\\'ve relied on in the business, where we never got involved.\"[103] Soon afterwards, the band began an ill-fated film project, Magical Mystery Tour. Starr\\'s growing interest in photography led to his billing as the movie\\'s Director of Photography, and his participation in the film\\'s editing was matched only by that of McCartney.[104] In February 1968, Starr became the first Beatle to sing on another artist\\'s show without the others. He sang the Buck Owens hit \"Act Naturally\", and performed a duet with Cilla Black, \"Do You Like Me Just a Little Bit?\" on her BBC One television programme, Cilla.[105]\\n', 'In November 1968, Apple Records released The Beatles, commonly known as the \"White Album\".[106] The album was partly inspired by the band\\'s recent interactions with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.[107] While attending the Maharishi\\'s intermediate course at his ashram in Rishikesh, India, they enjoyed one of their most prolific writing periods, composing most of the album there.[108] It was here that Starr completed his first recorded Beatles song, \"Don\\'t Pass Me By\",[109] but he left after 10 days and later compared his time there to a stay at Butlin\\'s.[110] The long-lasting health problems that began in his childhood had an impact on his time in India, causing him to experience allergies and sensitivities to the local food; when the band travelled there, he resorted to taking his own food with him.[111]\\n', 'Relations within the Beatles deteriorated during the recording of the White Album,[112] and there were occasions where only one or two members were involved in the recording of a track.[113] Starr had become tired of McCartney\\'s increasingly overbearing approach, Lennon\\'s passive-aggressive behaviour, and the near-constant presence of Lennon\\'s wife Yoko Ono.[113] After one particularly difficult session which included McCartney harshly criticising his drumming, Starr briefly quit the Beatles and went on holiday to Sardinia, where he and his family stayed on a boat loaned to them by actor Peter Sellers.[114] During a lunch there, the chef served octopus and Starr refused to eat it; an ensuing conversation with the ship\\'s captain about the animal inspired Starr\\'s song \"Octopus\\'s Garden\" from the Beatles\\' album Abbey Road, which he wrote using a guitar during the trip.[115] Two weeks later,[116] he returned to the studio to find that Harrison had covered his drum kit in flowers as a welcome-back gesture.[117]\\n', 'Despite a temporary return to friendly interactions during the completion of the White Album, production of the Beatles\\' fourth feature film Let It Be and its accompanying album further strained band relationships.[118] On 20 August 1969, the Beatles gathered for the final time at Abbey Road Studios for a mixing session for \"I Want You\".[119] At a business meeting exactly one month later, Lennon told the others that he was leaving the band, effective immediately.[120] However, the band\\'s break-up would not become public knowledge until McCartney\\'s announcement on 10 April 1970 that he was also leaving.[121]\\n', 'Solo career', '1970s', \"Shortly before McCartney announced his exit from the Beatles in April 1970, he and Starr had a falling out due to McCartney's refusal to cede the release date of his eponymous solo album to allow for Starr's debut, Sentimental Journey, and the Beatles' Let It Be.[122] Starr's album – composed of renditions of pre-rock standards that included musical arrangements by Quincy Jones, Maurice Gibb, George Martin and McCartney – peaked at number seven in the UK and number 22 in the US.[123] Starr followed Sentimental Journey with the country-inspired Beaucoups of Blues, engineered by Scotty Moore and featuring renowned Nashville session musician Pete Drake.[124] Despite favourable reviews, the album was a commercial failure.[125] Starr subsequently combined his musical activities with developing a career as a film actor.[126]\\n\", 'Starr played drums on Lennon\\'s John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), Ono\\'s Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band (1970), and on Harrison\\'s albums All Things Must Pass (1970), Living in the Material World (1973) and Dark Horse (1974).[127] In 1971, Starr participated in the Concert for Bangladesh, organised by Harrison, and with him co-wrote the hit single \"It Don\\'t Come Easy\", which reached number four in both the US and the UK.[128] The following year he released his most successful UK hit, \"Back Off Boogaloo\" (again produced and co-written by Harrison), which peaked at number two (US number nine).[129] Having become friends with the English singer Marc Bolan, Starr made his directorial debut with the 1972 T. Rex documentary Born to Boogie.[130]\\n', 'In 1973 and 1974, Starr had two number one hits in the US: \"Photograph\", a UK number eight hit co-written with Harrison, and \"You\\'re Sixteen\", written by the Sherman Brothers.[131] Starr\\'s third million-selling single in the US, \"You\\'re Sixteen\" was released in the UK in February 1974 where it peaked at number four.[132] Both tracks appeared on Starr\\'s debut rock album, Ringo, produced by Richard Perry and featuring further contributions from Harrison as well as a song each from Lennon and McCartney.[133] A commercial and critical success, the LP also included \"Oh My My\", a US number five.[134] The album reached number seven in the UK and number two in the US.[135] Author Peter Doggett describes Ringo as a template for Starr\\'s solo career, saying that, as a musician first rather than a songwriter, \"he would rely on his friends and his charm, and if both were on tap, then the results were usually appealing\".[136]\\n', 'Goodnight Vienna followed in 1974 and was also successful, reaching number eight in the US and number 30 in the UK.[137] Featuring contributions from Lennon, Elton John and Harry Nilsson, the album included a cover (suggested by Lennon) of the Platters\\' 1954 hit \"Only You (And You Alone)\", which peaked at number six in the US and number 28 in the UK, and Hoyt Axton\\'s \"No No Song\", which was a US number three and Starr\\'s seventh consecutive top-ten hit.[138] The Elton John-written \"Snookeroo\" failed to chart in the UK, however.[139] In mid-November 1974, a music video for the song and promotional film for the album was filmed on the rooftop of the Capitol Records Building in Los Angeles, designed to resemble a stack of discs. Lennon provided a voiceover as Starr\\'s spacecraft landed on the building and Starr boarded it before taking off over the city. Starr, Nilsson, and Keith Moon were among the cast, along with a forty-foot robot named \\'Gort\\' placed on the building.[140] During this period Starr became romantically involved with Lynsey de Paul.[141] He played tambourine on a song she wrote and produced for Vera Lynn, \"Don\\'t You Remember When\", and he inspired another De Paul song, \"If I Don\\'t Get You the Next One Will\", which she described as being about revenge after he missed a dinner appointment with her because he was asleep in his office.[141]\\n', 'Starr founded the record label Ring O\\' Records in 1975.[142][nb 7] The company signed eleven artists and released fifteen singles and five albums between 1975 and 1978, including works by David Hentschel, Graham Bonnet and Rab Noakes.[144] The commercial impact of Starr\\'s own career diminished over the same period, however, although he continued to record and remained a familiar celebrity presence.[145] Speaking in 2001, he attributed this downward turn to his \"[not] taking enough interest\" in music, saying of himself and friends such as Nilsson and Keith Moon: \"We weren\\'t musicians dabbling in drugs and alcohol; now we were junkies dabbling in music.\"[146] Starr, Nilsson and Moon were members of a drinking club, the Hollywood Vampires.[147]\\n', \"From the late 1960s until the mid-1980s, Starr and the designer Robin Cruikshank ran a furniture and interior design company, ROR.[148] ROR's designs were placed on sale in the department stores of Harvey Nichols and Liberty of London.[148] The company designed the interiors of palaces in Abu Dhabi and Oman, and the apartments of Paul Raymond and Starr's friend Nilsson.[149][150][151]\\n\", 'In November 1976, Starr appeared as a guest at the Band\\'s farewell concert, featured in the 1978 Martin Scorsese documentary The Last Waltz.[152] Also in 1976, Starr issued Ringo\\'s Rotogravure, the first release under his new contract with Atlantic Records for the North American market and Polydor for all other territories.[153] The album was produced by Arif Mardin and featured compositions by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison.[145] Starr promoted the release heavily, yet Rotogravure and its accompanying singles failed to chart in the UK.[154] In America, the LP produced two minor hits, \"A Dose of Rock \\'n\\' Roll\" (number 26) and a cover of \"Hey! Baby\" (number 74), and achieved moderate sales, reaching a chart position of 28.[145] Its disappointing performance inspired Atlantic to revamp Starr\\'s formula;[155] the result was a blend of disco and 1970s pop, Ringo the 4th (1977).[156] The album failed to chart in the UK and peaked at number 162 in the US.[157] In 1978 Starr released Bad Boy, which reached number 129 in the US and again failed to place on the UK albums chart.[158]\\n', \"In April 1979, Starr became seriously ill with intestinal problems relating to his childhood bout of peritonitis and was taken to the Princess Grace Hospital in Monte Carlo.

I lived in a blackout.\"[182][nb 9] Having embraced sobriety, Starr focused on re-establishing his career by making a return to touring.[184] On 23 July 1989, Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band gave their first performance to an audience of ten thousand in Dallas, Texas.[185] Setting a pattern that would continue over the following decades,[186] the band consisted of Starr and an assortment of musicians who had been successful in their own right at different times.[187] The concerts interchanged Starr\\'s singing, including selections of his Beatles and solo songs, with performances of each of the other artists\\' well-known material, the latter incorporating either Starr or another musician as drummer.[187]\\n', '1990s', 'The first All-Starr excursion led to the release of Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band (1990), a compilation of live performances from the 1989 tour.[188][nb 10] Also in 1990, Starr recorded a version of the song \"I Call Your Name\" for a television special marking the 10th anniversary of John Lennon\\'s death and the 50th anniversary of Lennon\\'s birth.

They recorded two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon and gave lengthy interviews about the Beatles\\' career.[197] Released in December 1995, \"Free as a Bird\" was the first new Beatles single since 1970.[198] In March 1996, they released a second single, \"Real Love\". The temporary reunion ended when Harrison refused to participate in the completion of a third song.[199] Starr then played drums on McCartney\\'s 1997 album Flaming Pie. Among the tracks to which he contributed, \"Little Willow\" was a song McCartney wrote about Starr\\'s ex-wife Maureen, who died in 1994, while \"Really Love You\" was the first official release ever credited to McCartney–Starkey.[200]\\n', \"In 1998, he released two albums on the Mercury label. The studio album Vertical Man marked the beginning of a nine-year partnership with Mark Hudson, who produced the album and, with his band the Roundheads, formed the core of the backing group on the recordings. In addition, many famous guests joined on various tracks, including Martin, Petty, McCartney and, in his final appearance on a Starr album, Harrison. Most of the songs were written by Starr and the band. Joe Walsh and the Roundheads joined Starr for his appearance on VH1 Storytellers, which was released as an album under the same name. During the show, he performed greatest hits and new songs and told anecdotes relating to them.[201] Starr's final release for Mercury was the 1999 Christmas-themed I Wanna Be Santa Claus. The album was a commercial failure, although the record company chose not to issue it in Britain.[202]\\n\", '2000s', 'Starr was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 2002, joining an elite group of drummers and percussionists that include Buddy Rich, William F.

In July, Starr became involved in \"#peacerocks\", an anti-violence campaign started by fashion designer John Varvatos, in conjunction with the David Lynch Foundation.[225][226] In September 2014, he won at the GQ Men of the Year Awards for his humanitarian work with the David Lynch Foundation.[227]\\n', \"In January 2015, Starr tweeted the title of his new studio album Postcards from Paradise. The album came a few weeks in advance of Starr's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and was released on 31 March 2015 to mixed to positive reviews.[228][229] Later that month, Starr and his band announced a forthcoming Summer 2016 Tour of the US. Full production began in June 2016 in Syracuse.[230]\\n\", 'On 7 July 2017 (his 77th birthday), Starr released \"Give More Love\" as a single, which was followed two months later by his nineteenth studio album, also titled Give More Love and issued by UMe.[231] The album includes appearances by McCartney, as well as frequent collaborators such as Joe Walsh, David A.

The tour was announced to run from 27 May to 26 June,[238] though several concerts held in June would end up being postponed till October due to two members of the band catching COVID-19. These postponed events were added to the band's previously announced fall tour to be held in September and October.[239] On 1 October, he cancelled a concert at the Four Winds New Buffalo casino due to an unspecified illness affecting his voice. Another concert to be held at Mystic Lake Casino Hotel the following day was also postponed.[240] On 3 October, it was confirmed that Starr had tested positive for COVID-19, after which several shows in Canada were cancelled.[241][242]\\n\", 'On 16 September 2022, Starr released the EP EP3.[243] On 12 January 2023, Starr announced that he and the All-Starr Band would be touring in the US that spring, from 19 May to 17 June.[244][245] In May 2023, a series of tour dates in the fall were also announced, from 17 September to 13 October.[246] Another EP by Starr, Rewind Forward, released on 13 October.[247]\\n', 'Artistry', 'Influences', 'During his youth, Starr had been a devoted fan of skiffle and blues music, but by the time he joined the Texans in 1958, he had developed a preference for rock and roll.[248] He was also influenced by country artists, including Hank Williams, Buck Owens and Hank Snow, and jazz artists such as Chico Hamilton and Yusef Lateef, whose compositional style inspired Starr\\'s fluid and energetic drum fills and grooves.[249] While reflecting on Buddy Rich, Starr commented: \"He does things with one hand that I can\\'t do with nine, but that\\'s technique. Everyone I talk to says \\'What about Buddy Rich?\\' Well, what about him? Because he doesn\\'t turn me on.\"[250] He stated that he \"was never really into drummers\", but identified Cozy Cole\\'s 1958 cover of Benny Goodman\\'s \"Topsy Part Two\" as \"the one drum record\" he bought.[251]\\n', 'Starr\\'s first musical hero was Gene Autry, about whom he commented: \"I remember getting shivers up my back when he sang, \\'South of the Border\\'\".[252] By the early 1960s he had become an ardent fan of Lee Dorsey.[253] In November 1964, Starr told Melody Maker: \"Our music is second-hand versions of negro music ... Ninety per cent of the music I like is coloured.\"[254]\\n', 'Drums', 'Starr said of his drumming: \"I\\'m no good on the technical things ... I\\'m your basic offbeat drummer with funny fills ... because I\\'m really left-handed playing a right-handed kit. I can\\'t roll around the drums because of that.\"[255] Beatles producer George Martin said: \"Ringo hit good and hard and used the tom-tom well, even though he couldn\\'t do a roll to save his life\", but later said, \"He\\'s got tremendous feel. He always helped us to hit the right tempo for a song, and gave it that support – that rock-solid back-beat – that made the recording of all the Beatles\\' songs that much easier.\"[255] Starr said he did not believe the drummer\\'s role was to \"interpret the song\". Instead, comparing his drumming to painting, he said: \"I am the foundation, and then I put a bit of glow here and there ... If there\\'s a gap, I want to be good enough to fill it.\"[250]\\n', 'In 2011, Rolling Stone readers voted Starr the fifth-greatest drummer of all time.[256] Journalist Robyn Flans wrote for the Percussive Arts Society: \"I cannot count the number of drummers who have told me that Ringo inspired their passion for drums\".[4] Drummer Steve Smith said:\\n', \"Before Ringo, drum stars were measured by their soloing ability and virtuosity. Ringo's popularity brought forth a new paradigm in how the public saw drummers. We started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect. One of Ringo's great qualities was that he composed unique, stylistic drum parts for the Beatles' songs. His parts are so signature to the songs that you can listen to a Ringo drum part without the rest of the music and still identify the song.[4]\", 'Starr said his favourite drummer is Jim Keltner,[257] with whom he first played at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971.[258] The pair subsequently played drums together on some of Harrison\\'s recordings during the 1970s,[259] on Ringo and other albums by Starr, and on the early All-Starr Band tours.[260] For Ringo\\'s Rotogravure in 1976, Starr credited himself as \"Thunder\" and Keltner as \"Lightnin\\'\".[259]\\n', 'Starr influenced the Genesis drummer Phil Collins,[261] who said: \"I think he\\'s vastly underrated, Ringo. The drum fills on \\'A Day in the Life\\' are very, very complex things. You could take a great drummer from today and say, \\'I want it like that\\', and they really wouldn\\'t know what to do.\"[262] Collins said his drumming on the 1983 Genesis song \"That\\'s All\" was an affectionate attempt at a \"Ringo Starr drum part\".[263]\\n', 'In an often-repeated but apocryphal story, when asked if Starr was the best drummer in the world, Lennon quipped that he \"wasn\\'t even the best drummer in the Beatles\". The line actually comes from a 1981 episode of the BBC Radio 4 comedy series Radio Active,[264] and gained more prominence when it was used by the television comedian Jasper Carrott in 1983, three years after Lennon\\'s death.[265] In September 1980, Lennon told Rolling Stone that Starr was a \"damn good drummer\" whose talent would have surfaced even without the Beatles.[266]\\n', 'Tjinder Singh of the indie rock band Cornershop said Starr was a pioneering drummer: \"There was a time when the common consensus was that Ringo couldn\\'t play. What\\'s that all about? He\\'s totally unique, a one-off, and hip hop has a lot to thank him for.\"[267] In his book The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, Mark Lewisohn says there were fewer than a dozen occasions in the Beatles\\' eight-year recording career where session breakdowns were caused by Starr making a mistake, while the vast majority of takes were stopped due to mistakes by the other Beatles.[268] Starr influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings.[4] According to Ken Micallef and Donnie Marshall, co-authors of Classic Rock Drummers: \"Ringo\\'s fat tom sounds and delicate cymbal work were imitated by thousands of drummers.\"[269]\\n', 'In 2021, Starr announced a ten-part MasterClass course called \"Drumming and Creative Collaboration\".[270]\\n', 'Vocals', 'Starr sang lead vocals for a song on most of the Beatles\\' studio albums as part of an attempt to establish a vocal personality for each band member. In many cases, Lennon or McCartney wrote the lyrics and melody especially for him, as they did for \"Yellow Submarine\" from Revolver and \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" on Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band.[271] These melodies were tailored to Starr\\'s limited baritone vocal range. Because of his distinctive voice, Starr rarely performed backing vocals during his time with the Beatles, but they can be heard on songs such as \"Maxwell\\'s Silver Hammer\" and \"Carry That Weight\".[272] He is also the lead vocalist on his compositions \"Don\\'t Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus\\'s Garden\".[273] In addition, he sang lead on \"I Wanna Be Your Man\", \"Boys\", \"Matchbox\", \"Honey Don\\'t\", \"Act Naturally\", \"Good Night\" and \"What Goes On\".[274]\\n', 'Songwriting', 'Starr\\'s idiosyncratic turns of phrase or \"Ringoisms\", such as \"a hard day\\'s night\" and \"tomorrow never knows\", were used as song titles by the Beatles, particularly by Lennon.[275] McCartney commented: \"Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic.\"[276] Starr also occasionally contributed lyrics to unfinished Lennon–McCartney songs, such as the line \"darning his socks in the night when there\\'s nobody there\" in \"Eleanor Rigby\".[277]\\n', 'Starr is credited as the sole composer of two Beatles songs: \"Don\\'t Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus\\'s Garden\", the latter written with assistance from Harrison.[278] While promoting the Abbey Road album in 1969, Harrison recognised Starr\\'s lyrics to \"Octopus\\'s Garden\" as an unwittingly profound message about finding inner peace, and therefore an example of how \"Ringo writes his cosmic songs without knowing it.\"[279] Starr is also credited as a co-writer of \"What Goes On\", \"Flying\" and \"Dig It\".[280][nb 12] On material issued after the band\\'s break-up, he received a writing credit for \"Taking a Trip to Carolina\" and joint songwriting credits with the other Beatles for \"12-Bar Original\", \"Los Paranoias\", \"Christmas Time (Is Here Again)\", \"Suzy Parker\" (from the Let It Be film), \"Jessie\\'s Dream\" (from the Magical Mystery Tour film), \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Now and Then\".[281]\\n', 'In a 2003 interview, Starr discussed Harrison\\'s input in his songwriting and said: \"I was great at writing two verses and a chorus – I\\'m still pretty good at that. Finishing songs is not my forte.\"[282] Harrison helped Starr complete two of his biggest hit songs, \"It Don\\'t Come Easy\" and \"Back Off Boogaloo\",[282] although he only accepted a credit for \"Photograph\", which they wrote together in France.[283] Starting with the Ringo album in 1973, Starr shared a songwriting partnership with Vini Poncia.[284] One of the pair\\'s first collaborations was \"Oh My My\".[284] Over half of the songs on Ringo the 4th were Starkey–Poncia compositions, but the partnership produced just two more songs, released on Bad Boy in 1978.[285]\\n', 'Personal life', 'Starr met hairdresser Maureen Cox in 1962, the same week that he joined the Beatles. They married in February 1965.[286] Beatles manager Brian Epstein was best man and Starr\\'s stepfather Harry Graves and fellow Beatle George Harrison were witnesses.[287] Their marriage became the subject of the novelty song \"Treat Him Tender, Maureen\" by the Chicklettes.[288] The couple had three children: Zak (b. 13 September 1965), Jason (b. 19 August 1967) and Lee (b. 11 November 1970).[289] In 1971, Starr purchased Lennon\\'s home Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire and moved his family there.[290] The couple divorced in 1975 following Starr\\'s repeated infidelities.[291] Cox died from leukaemia at the age of 48 in 1994.[292]\\n', \"Starr met actress Barbara Bach in 1980 on the set of the film Caveman, and they were married at Marylebone Town Hall on 27 April 1981.[293][294] In 1985, he was the first of the Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of Zak's daughter Tatia Jayne Starkey.[295] Zak is also a drummer, and he spent time with the Who's Keith Moon during his father's regular absences;[296] he has performed with his father during some All-Starr Band tours.[297] Starr has eight grandchildren: two from Zak, three from Jason, and three from Lee.[298] In 2016, he was the first Beatle to become a great-grandfather.[299]\\n\", \"Starr and Bach split their time between homes in Cranleigh in Sussex, Los Angeles, and Monte Carlo.[300] He was listed at number 56 in the Sunday Times Rich List 2011 with an estimated personal wealth of £150\\xa0million.[301] In 2012, he was estimated to be the wealthiest drummer in the world.[302] In 2014, Starr announced that his 200-acre (81\\xa0ha) Surrey estate at Rydinghurst at Cranleigh was for sale, with its Grade II-listed Jacobean house.[303][304] However, he retains a property in the London district of Chelsea off King's Road, and he and Bach continue to divide their time between London and Los Angeles.[305]\\n\", 'In December 2015, Starr and Bach auctioned some of their personal and professional items via Julien\\'s Auctions in Los Angeles.[306] The collection included Starr\\'s first Ludwig Black Oyster Pearl drum kit, instruments given to him by Harrison, Lennon, and Marc Bolan,[306] and a first-pressing copy of the Beatles\\' White Album numbered \"0000001\".[307] The auction raised over $9\\xa0million,[308] a portion of which was set aside for the Lotus Foundation, a charity founded by Starr and Bach.[309]\\n', 'In 2016, Starr expressed his support for the United Kingdom\\'s withdrawal from the European Union. \"I thought the European Union was a great idea,\" he said, \"but I didn\\'t see it going anywhere lately.\"[310] In 2017, he described his impatience for Britain to \"get on with\" Brexit, declaring that \"to be in control of your country is a good move\".[311]\\n', 'In October 2021, Starr was named in the Pandora Papers, which alleged secret financial deals among  politicians and celebrities using tax havens in an effort to avoid the payment of owed taxes.[312]\\n', 'Starr is a vegetarian, although Mary McCartney confirmed he is allergic to garlic and onions.[313][314] He meditates daily,[315] and his catchphrase and motto for life is \"peace and love\".[314]\\n', 'Awards and honours', \"Starr and the other members of the Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1965 Birthday Honours;[316] they received their insignia from Queen Elizabeth II at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October.[317] He and the other Beatles were collectively nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer for their performances in the 1964 film A Hard Day's Night.[318] In 1971, the Beatles received an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be.[319] The minor planet 4150 Starr, discovered on 31 August 1984 by Brian A.

      "['From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia', 'Contents', 'Dartmouth College', '\\n', 'Dartmouth College (/ˈdɑːrtməθ/; DART-məth) is a private Ivy League research university in Hanover, New Hampshire. Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, Dartmouth is one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Emerging into national prominence at the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth has since been considered among the most prestigious undergraduate colleges in the United States.[9]\\n', 'Although originally established to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the English way of life, the university primarily trained Congregationalist ministers during its early history before it gradually secularized. While Dartmouth is now a research university rather than simply an undergraduate college, it continues to go by \"Dartmouth College\" to emphasize its focus on undergraduate education.\\n', 'Following a liberal arts curriculum, Dartmouth provides undergraduate instruction in 40 academic departments and interdisciplinary programs, including 60 majors in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering, and enables students to design specialized concentrations or engage in dual degree programs.[10] In addition to the undergraduate faculty of arts and sciences, Dartmouth has four professional and graduate schools: the Geisel School of Medicine, the Thayer School of Engineering, the Tuck School of Business, and the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies.[11] The university also has affiliations with the Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center. Dartmouth is home to the Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and the Social Sciences, the Hood Museum of Art, the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding, and the Hopkins Center for the Arts. With a student enrollment of about 6,700, Dartmouth is the smallest university in the Ivy League. Undergraduate admissions are highly selective with an acceptance rate of 5.3% for the class of 2028, including a 3.8% rate for regular decision applicants.[12]\\n', \"Situated on a terrace above the Connecticut River, Dartmouth's 269-acre (109\\xa0ha) main campus is in the rural Upper Valley region of New England.[13] The university functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms.[14] Dartmouth is known for its undergraduate focus, Greek culture, and campus traditions.[15][16] Its 34 varsity sports teams compete intercollegiately in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I. The university has many prominent alumni, including 170 members of the United States Congress,[17] 24 U.S. governors, 8 U.S. Cabinet secretaries, 3 Nobel Prize laureates, 2 U.S. Supreme Court justices, and a U.S. vice president. Other notable alumni include 81 Rhodes Scholars,[18] 26 Marshall Scholarship recipients,[19] 13 Pulitzer Prize recipients, 10 CEOs of Fortune 500 companies,[20] and 51 Olympic medalists.[21]\\n\", 'History[edit]', \"Dartmouth was founded by Eleazar Wheelock, a Yale graduate and Congregational minister from Windham, Connecticut, who had sought to establish a school to train Native Americans as Christian missionaries. It was one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Wheelock's ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with Mohegan Indian Samson Occom. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from 1743 to 1747, and later moved to Long Island to preach to the Montauks.[22]\\n\", \"Wheelock founded Moor's Indian Charity School in 1755.[23] The Charity School proved somewhat successful, but additional funding was necessary to continue school's operations, and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money. The first major donation to the school was given by John Phillips in 1762, who would go on to found Phillips Exeter Academy. Occom, accompanied by the Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker, traveled to England in 1766 to raise money from churches. With these funds, they established a trust to help Wheelock.[22] The head of the trust was a Methodist named William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth.\\n\", 'Although the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School, Wheelock initially had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution, primarily because its location was far from tribal territories. In seeking to expand the school into a college, Wheelock relocated it to Hanover, in the Province of New Hampshire. The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter. The Royal Governor of New Hampshire, John Wentworth, provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13, 1769, issued a royal charter in the name of King George III establishing the college. That charter created a college \"for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing & all parts of Learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences and also of English Youth and any others\". The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable the use of the Charity School\\'s unspent trust funds. Named for William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth – an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock\\'s earlier efforts but who, in fact, opposed creation of the college and never donated to it – Dartmouth is the nation\\'s ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under Colonial rule.[24] The college granted its first degrees in 1771.[9]\\n', \"Given the limited success of the Charity School, however, Wheelock intended his new college as one primarily for whites.[22][25] Occom, disappointed with Wheelock's departure from the school's original goal of Indian Christianization, went on to form his own community of New England Indians called Brothertown Indians in New York.[22][25]\\n\", 'In 1819, Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic Dartmouth College case, which challenged New Hampshire\\'s 1816 attempt to amend the college\\' charter to make the school a public university. An institution called Dartmouth University occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the college continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby.[22] Daniel Webster, an alumnus of the class of 1801, presented the college\\'s case to the Supreme Court, which found the amendment of Dartmouth\\'s charter to be an illegal impairment of a contract by the state and reversed New Hampshire\\'s takeover of the college. Webster concluded his peroration with the famous words: \"It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it.\"[22]\\n', 'Dartmouth taught its first African-American students in 1775 and 1808. By the end of the Civil War, 20 black men had attended the college or its medical school.[27] and Dartmouth \"was recognized in the African-American community as a place where a man of color could go to get educated\".[28] One of them, Jonathan C. Gibbs, served as Secretary of State and Superintendent of Public Instruction for the state of Florida.\\n', \"In 1866, the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts was incorporated in Hanover, in connection with Dartmouth College. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth and was directed by Dartmouth's president. The new college was moved to Durham, New Hampshire, in 1891, and later became known as the University of New Hampshire.[29]\\n\", '\\nDartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to this period, the college had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded.[30] Under President William Jewett Tucker (1893–1909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body, following large endowments such as the $10,000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor John Ordronaux.[31] 20 new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold. Tucker is often credited for having \"refounded Dartmouth\" and bringing it into national prestige.[32] ', \"Presidents Ernest Fox Nichols (1909–16) and Ernest Martin Hopkins (1916–45) continued Tucker's trend of modernization, further improving campus facilities and introducing selective admissions in the 1920s.[30] In 1945, Hopkins was subject to no small amount of controversy, as he openly admitted to Dartmouth's practice of using racial quotas to deny Jews entry into the university.[33][34] John Sloan Dickey, serving as president from 1945 until 1970, strongly emphasized the liberal arts, particularly public policy and international relations.[30][35] During World War II, Dartmouth was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a navy commission.[36]\\n\", 'The Dartmouth workshop, which was held in 1956, is widely considered to be the founding event of artificial intelligence as a field.\\n', 'In 1970, longtime professor of mathematics and computer science John George Kemeny became president of Dartmouth.[37] Kemeny oversaw several major changes at the college. Dartmouth, which had been a men\\'s institution, began admitting women as full-time students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy.[38] At about the same time, the college adopted its \"Dartmouth Plan\" of academic scheduling, permitting the student body to increase in size within the existing facilities.[37]\\n', 'In 1988, Dartmouth\\'s alma mater song\\'s lyrics changed from \"Men of Dartmouth\" to \"Dear old Dartmouth\".[39]\\n', 'During the 1990s, the college saw a major academic overhaul under President James O.

These two departments are known for enforcing a median grade of B+ in most of their courses in order to curb the burgeoning trend of grade inflation at American universities.  \\n\", 'In order to graduate, a student must complete 35 total courses, eight to ten of which are typically part of a chosen major program.[59] Other requirements for graduation include the completion of ten \"distributive requirements\" in a variety of academic fields, proficiency in a foreign language, and completion of a writing class and first-year seminar in writing.[59] Many departments offer honors programs requiring students seeking that distinction to engage in \"independent, sustained work\", culminating in the production of a thesis.[59] In addition to the courses offered in Hanover, Dartmouth offers 57 different off-campus programs, including Foreign Study Programs, Language Study Abroad programs, and Exchange Programs.[60][61]\\n', 'Through the Graduate Studies program, Dartmouth grants doctorate and master\\'s degrees in 19 Arts & Sciences graduate programs. Although the first graduate degree, a PhD in classics, was awarded in 1885, many of the current PhD programs have only existed since the 1960s.[54] Furthermore, Dartmouth is home to three professional schools: the Geisel School of Medicine (established 1797), Thayer School of Engineering (1867)—which also serves as the undergraduate department of engineering sciences—and Tuck School of Business (1900). With these professional schools and graduate programs, conventional American usage would accord Dartmouth the label of \"Dartmouth University\";[54] however, because of historical and nostalgic reasons (such as Dartmouth College v. Woodward), the school uses the name \"Dartmouth College\" to refer to the entire institution.[22]\\n', 'Dartmouth employs a total of 607 tenured or tenure-track faculty members, including the highest proportion of female tenured professors among the Ivy League universities,[54] and the first black woman tenure-track faculty member in computer science at an Ivy League university.[62] Faculty members have been at the forefront of such major academic developments as the Dartmouth Workshop, the Dartmouth Time Sharing System, Dartmouth BASIC, and Dartmouth ALGOL 30.

The Dartmouth Plan (or simply \"D-Plan\") is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student\\'s academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman year and two terms of their senior year, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year.[99] However, students may petition to alter this plan so that they may be off during terms of their senior year or sophomore summer terms.[100] During all terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects.[99] The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for 12 total terms over the course of their academic career.[101]\\n', 'The D-Plan was instituted in the early 1970s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates. It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations, and has been described as \"a way to put 4,000 students into 3,000 beds\".[30] Although new dormitories have been built since, the number of students has also increased and the D-Plan remains in effect. It was modified in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce the problems of lack of social and academic continuity.\\n', 'Board of trustees[edit]', 'Dartmouth is governed by a board of trustees comprising the college president (ex officio), the state governor (ex officio), 13 trustees nominated and elected by the board (called \"charter trustees\"), and eight trustees nominated by alumni and elected by the board (\"alumni trustees\").[102] The nominees for alumni trustee are determined by a poll of the members of the Association of Alumni of Dartmouth College, selecting from among names put forward by the Alumni Council or by alumni petition.\\n', 'Although the board elected its members from the two sources of nominees in equal proportions between 1891 and 2007,[103] the board decided in 2007 to add several new members, all charter trustees.[104] In the controversy that followed the decision, the Association of Alumni filed a lawsuit, although it later withdrew the action.[105][106] In 2008, the board added five new charter trustees.[107]\\n', 'Campus[edit]', 'This is what a college is supposed to look like.\\n', '—U.S. President Dwight D.

The Latin motto is literally translated as \"The voice of one crying in the wilderness\",[212][213] but is more often rendered as \"A voice crying out in the wilderness\".[1] The phrase appears five times in the Bible and is a reference to the college\\'s location on what was once the frontier of European settlement.[213][214] Richard Hovey\\'s \"Men of Dartmouth\" was elected as the best of Dartmouth\\'s songs in 1896,[205] and became the school\\'s official song in 1926.[215] The song was retitled to \"Alma Mater\" in the 1980s when its lyrics were changed to refer to women as well as men.[216]\\n', 'Seal[edit]', \"Dartmouth's 1769 royal charter required the creation of a seal for use on official documents and diplomas.[199] The college's founder, Eleazar Wheelock, designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, a missionary society founded in London in 1701, in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education.[213] Engraved by a Boston silversmith, the seal was ready by commencement of 1773. The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25, 1773, describing it as:\\n\", 'An Oval, circumscribed by a Line containing SIGILL: COL: DARTMUTH: NOV: HANT: IN AMERICA 1770. within projecting a Pine Grove on the Right, whence proceed Natives towards an Edifice two Storey on the left; which bears in a Label over the Grove these Words \"vox clamantis in deserto\" the whole supported by Religion on the Right and Justice on the Left, and bearing in a Triangle irradiate, with the Hebrew Words [El Shaddai], agreeable to the above Impression, be the common Seal under which to pass all Diplomas or Certificates of Degrees, and all other Affairs of Business of and concerning Dartmouth College.[217]', 'On October 28, 1926, the trustees affirmed the charter\\'s reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone.[213] The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer William Addison Dwiggins to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. Dwiggins\\' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from \"1770\" to \"1769\", to accord with the date of the college charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of \"1769\" to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use.[213] The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.[218]\\n', 'Shield[edit]', 'On October 28, 1926, the trustees approved a \"Dartmouth College Shield\" for general use. Artist and engraver W. Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal. This design does not survive. On June 9, 1944, the trustees approved another coat of arms based on the shield part of the seal, this one by Canadian artist and designer Thoreau MacDonald. That design was used widely and, like Dwiggins\\' seal, had its date changed from \"1770\" to \"1769\" around 1958.[213] That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others.[218]\\n', \"College designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s, but it did not see the success of MacDonald's design.[219] The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of the Geisel School of Medicine, and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 micrometers across.[220] The design has appeared on Rudolph Ruzicka's Bicentennial Medal (Philadelphia Mint, 1969) and elsewhere.\\n\", 'Nickname, symbol, and mascot[edit]', 'Dartmouth has never had an official mascot.[221] The nickname \"The Big Green\",[222] originating in the 1860s, is based on students\\' adoption of a shade of forest green (\"Dartmouth Green\") as the school\\'s official color in 1866.[223][224] Beginning in the 1920s, the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname \"the Indians\", a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists.[221] This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early 1970s, when its use came under criticism. In 1974, the Trustees declared the \"use of the [Indian] symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education\".[225] Some alumni and students, as well as the conservative student newspaper, The Dartmouth Review, have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence,[226] but never succeeded in doing so.[227]\\n', 'Various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a mascot, but none has become \"official\". One proposal devised by the college humor magazine the Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern was Keggy the Keg, an anthropomorphic beer keg who makes occasional appearances at college sporting events. Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy,[228] the mascot has received approval from only the student government.[229] In November 2006, student government attempted to revive the \"Dartmoose\" as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former unofficial Indian mascot.[230]\\n', 'Alumni[edit]', \"Dartmouth's alumni are known for frequently donating to their alma mater.[231] Most start by giving to the Senior Class Gift. According to a 2008 article in The Wall Street Journal based on data from payscale.com, Dartmouth graduates also earn higher median salaries at least 10 years after graduation than alumni of any other American university surveyed.[232]\\n\", 'By 2008, Dartmouth had graduated 238 classes of students, and had over 60,000 living alumni in a variety of fields.[233] Finance, consulting, and technology have consistently been the most popular industries to enter for students.[234] Top employers of new graduates include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, McKinsey & Company, Bain & Company, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.\\n', 'Nelson A.

If two institutions were to merge, the very fact of merger would mean that the merged institution would do nearly twice as well as either of the individual institutions prior to merger, although nothing else had changed.\\n\\n^ \"Carnegie Classifications | Institution Profile\".

The College\\'s claim on the landscape began with the felling of the great white pines that grew on the plain above the Connecticut River; planting came later.

The Federal Government in Washington D.C. and states under its control were known as the Union.[9][12][18]\\n', \"The Civil War began on April 12, 1861, when the South Carolina militia attacked Fort Sumter. Four slave states of the Upper South—Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina—then joined the Confederacy. On February 22, 1862, Confederate States Army leaders re-installed a federal government in Richmond, Virginia, and enacted the first Confederate draft on April 16, 1862. By 1865, the Confederacy's federal government dissolved into chaos: the Confederate States Congress adjourned, effectively ceasing to exist as a legislative body on March 18. After four years of heavy fighting, nearly all Confederate land and naval forces either surrendered or otherwise ceased hostilities by May 1865.[19][20] The most significant capitulation was Confederate general Robert E. Lee's surrender on April 9, after which any doubt about the war's outcome or the Confederacy's survival was extinguished. Confederate President Davis's administration declared the Confederacy dissolved on May 5.[21][22][23]\\n\", 'After the war, during the Reconstruction era, the Confederate states were readmitted to the Congress after each ratified the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution outlawing slavery. Lost Cause mythology, an idealized view of the Confederacy valiantly fighting for a just cause, emerged in the decades after the war among former Confederate generals and politicians, and in organizations such as the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Intense periods of Lost Cause activity developed around the turn of the 20th century and during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s in reaction to growing support for racial equality. Advocates sought to ensure future generations of Southern whites would continue to support white supremacist policies such as the Jim Crow laws through activities such as building Confederate monuments and influencing the authors of textbooks.[24] The modern display of the Confederate battle flag primarily started during the 1948 presidential election, when the battle flag was used by the Dixiecrats. During the civil rights movement, racial segregationists used it for demonstrations.[25][26]\\n', 'Span of control', 'On February 22, 1862, the Confederate States Constitution of seven state signatories—Mississippi, South Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas—replaced the Provisional Constitution of February 8, 1861, with one stating in its preamble a desire for a \"permanent federal government\". Four additional slave-holding states—Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina—declared their secession and joined the Confederacy following a call by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln for troops from each state to recapture Sumter and other seized federal properties in the South.[27]\\n', 'Missouri and Kentucky were represented by partisan factions adopting the forms of state governments in the Confederate government of Missouri and Confederate government of Kentucky, and the Confederacy controlled more than half of Kentucky and the southern portion of Missouri early in the war. Neither state\\'s Confederate governments controlled any substantial territory or population in either case after 1862. The antebellum state governments in both maintained their representation in the Union. Also fighting for the Confederacy were two of the \"Five Civilized Tribes\"—the Choctaw and the Chickasaw—in Indian Territory, and a new, but uncontrolled, Confederate Territory of Arizona. Efforts by certain factions in Maryland to secede were halted by federal imposition of martial law; Delaware, though of divided loyalty, did not attempt it. A Unionist government was formed in opposition to the secessionist state government in Richmond and administered the western parts of Virginia that had been occupied by Federal troops. The Restored Government of Virginia later recognized the new state of West Virginia, which was admitted to the Union during the war on June 20, 1863, and relocated to Alexandria for the rest of the war.[27]\\n', 'Confederate control over its claimed territory and population in congressional districts steadily shrank from three-quarters to a third during the American Civil War due to the Union\\'s successful overland campaigns, its control of inland waterways into the South, and its blockade of the southern coast.[28] With the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, the Union made abolition of slavery a war goal (in addition to reunion). As Union forces moved southward, large numbers of plantation slaves were freed. Many joined the Union lines, enrolling in service as soldiers, teamsters and laborers. The most notable advance was Sherman\\'s \"March to the Sea\" in late 1864. Much of the Confederacy\\'s infrastructure was destroyed, including telegraphs, railroads, and bridges. Plantations in the path of Sherman\\'s forces were severely damaged. Internal movement within the Confederacy became increasingly difficult, weakening its economy and limiting army mobility.[29]\\n', \"These losses created an insurmountable disadvantage in men, materiel, and finance. Public support for Confederate President Jefferson Davis's administration eroded over time due to repeated military reverses, economic hardships, and allegations of autocratic government. After four years of campaigning, Richmond was captured by Union forces in April 1865. A few days later General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant, effectively signaling the collapse of the Confederacy. President Davis was captured on May 10, 1865, and jailed for treason, but no trial was ever held.[30]\\n\", 'History', \"The Confederacy was established by the Montgomery Convention in February 1861 by seven states (South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, adding Texas in March before Lincoln's inauguration), expanded in May–July 1861 (with Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina), and disintegrated in April–May 1865. It was formed by delegations from seven slave states of the Lower South that had proclaimed their secession. After the fighting began in April, four additional slave states seceded and were admitted. Later, two slave states (Missouri and Kentucky) and two territories were given seats in the Confederate Congress.[31]\\n\", 'Its establishment flowed from and deepened Southern nationalism,[32] which prepared men to fight for \"The Southern Cause\".[33] This \"Cause\" included support for states\\' rights, tariff policy, and internal improvements, but above all, cultural and financial dependence on the South\\'s slavery-based economy. The convergence of race and slavery, politics, and economics raised South-related policy questions to the status of moral questions over, way of life, merging love of things Southern and hatred of things Northern. As the war approached, political parties split, and national churches and interstate families divided along sectional lines.[34] According to historian John M. Coski:\\n', 'The statesmen who led the secession movement were unashamed to explicitly cite the defense of slavery as their prime motive\\xa0... Acknowledging the centrality of slavery to the Confederacy is essential for understanding the Confederate.[35]', 'Southern Democrats had chosen John Breckinridge as their candidate during the 1860 presidential election, but in no Southern state was support for him unanimous, as they recorded at least some popular vote for at least one of the other three candidates (Abraham Lincoln, Stephen A. Douglas and John Bell). Support for these three collectively, ranged from significant to outright majority, running from 25% in Texas to 81% in Missouri.[36] There were minority views everywhere, especially in the upland and plateau areas of the South, particularly concentrated in western Virginia and eastern Tennessee. The first six signatory states establishing the Confederacy counted about one-fourth its population. They voted 43% for pro-Union candidates. The four states which entered after the attack on Fort Sumter held almost half the population of the Confederacy and voted 53% for pro-Union candidates. The three big turnout states voted extremes; Texas, with 5% of the population, voted 20% for pro-Union candidates; Kentucky and Missouri, with one-fourth the Confederate population, voted 68% for pro-Union.\\n', 'Following South Carolina\\'s unanimous 1860 secession vote, no other Southern states considered the question until 1861; when they did, none had a unanimous vote. All had residents who cast significant numbers of Unionist votes. Voting to remain in the Union did not necessarily mean individuals were sympathizers with the North. Once fighting began, many who voted to remain in the Union accepted the majority decision, and supported the Confederacy.[37] Many writers have evaluated the War as an American tragedy—a \"Brothers\\' War\", pitting \"brother against brother, father against son, kin against kin of every degree\".[38][39]\\n', 'Origins', 'The Confederacy, as a state power, was created by secessionists in Southern slave states, who believed the federal government was making them second-class citizens.[40] They judged the agents of change to be abolitionists and anti-slavery elements in the Republican Party, whom they believed used insult and injury to subject them to intolerable \"humiliation and degradation\".[40] The \"Black Republicans\" (as the Southerners called them) and their allies soon dominated the U.S. House, Senate, and Presidency. On the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney (a presumed supporter of slavery) was 83 years old and ailing.\\n', 'During the 1860 election, some secessionists threatened disunion should Lincoln (who opposed the expansion of slavery into the territories) be elected, including William L. Yancey. Yancey toured the North calling for secession as Stephen A. Douglas toured the South calling for union if Lincoln was elected.[41] To the secessionists the Republican intent was clear: to contain slavery within its present bounds and, eventually, to eliminate it entirely. A Lincoln victory presented them with a choice: \"the Union without slavery, or slavery without the Union\".[42]\\n', 'Causes of secession', 'The new [Confederate] Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions—African slavery as it exists among us—the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the \"rock upon which the old Union would split.\" He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted.\\n', 'The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution were, that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away... Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the idea of a Government built upon it—when the \"storm came and the wind blew, it fell.\"\\n', 'Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.\\n', 'Alexander H. Stephens, speech to The Savannah Theatre. (March 21, 1861)', 'The immediate catalyst for secession was the victory of the Republican Party and Lincoln\\'s election. For Southerners, the most ominous feature of the Republican victories in the congressional and presidential elections was the magnitude: Republicans captured over 60% of the Northern vote and 75% of its Congressional delegations.[43] The Southern press said that such Republicans represented the anti-slavery portion of the North, \"a party founded on the single sentiment ... of hatred of African slavery\", and now the controlling power in national affairs. The \"Black Republican party\" could overwhelm the status of white supremacy in the South. The New Orleans Delta said of the Republicans, \"It is in fact, essentially, a revolutionary party\" to overthrow slavery.[44] By 1860, sectional disagreements between North and South concerned primarily the status of slavery in the United States. The specific question was whether slavery would be permitted to expand into the western territories, leading to more slave states, or be prevented, which was widely believed would place slavery on a course of extinction. Historian Drew Gilpin Faust observed that \"leaders of the secession movement across the South cited slavery as the most compelling reason for southern independence\".[45] Although most white Southerners did not own slaves, most supported the institution of slavery and benefited indirectly from the slave society. For struggling yeomen and subsistence farmers, it provided a large class of people ranked lower than themselves.[46] Secondary differences related to free speech, runaway slaves, expansion into Cuba, and states\\' rights.\\n', \"Historian Emory Thomas assessed the Confederacy's self-image by studying correspondence sent by the Confederate government in 1861–62 to foreign governments. He found that Confederate diplomacy projected multiple contradictory self-images:\\n\", \"The Southern nation was by turns a guileless people attacked by a voracious neighbor, an 'established' nation in some temporary difficulty, a collection of bucolic aristocrats making a romantic stand against the banalities of industrial democracy, a cabal of commercial farmers seeking to make a pawn of King Cotton, an apotheosis of nineteenth-century nationalism and revolutionary liberalism, or the ultimate statement of social and economic reaction.[47]\", 'The Cornerstone Speech is frequently cited in analysis surrounding Confederate ideology.[48] In it, Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens declared that the \"cornerstone\" of the new government \"rest[ed] upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man\". Stephens\\' speech criticized the Founding Fathers for their views on slavery, accusing them of erroneously assuming that races are equal. He declared that disagreements over the enslavement of African Americans were the \"immediate cause\" of secession and that the Confederate constitution had resolved such issues.[49] Stephens contended that advances in the sciences proved that the Declaration of Independence\\'s view that \"all men are created equal\" was erroneous, while stating that the Confederacy was the first country founded on the principle of white supremacy and that chattel slavery coincided with the Bible\\'s teachings. After the Confederacy\\'s defeat in the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, he attempted to retroactively deny and retract the opinions in the speech. Denying his statements that slavery was the Confederacy\\'s cause for leaving the Union, he contended that the war was rooted in constitutional differences;[50][51] this explanation by Stephens is widely rejected by historians.[48][52]\\n', 'Four of the seceding states, the Deep South states of South Carolina,[53]\\nMississippi,[54] Georgia,[55] and Texas,[56] issued formal declarations of the causes of their decision; each identified the threat to slaveholders\\' rights. Georgia also claimed a Federal policy of favoring Northern over Southern economic interests. Texas mentioned slavery 21 times, but also listed the failure of the federal government to live up to its obligations, in the original annexation agreement, to protect settlers along the exposed western frontier. Texas resolutions stated that governments of the states and the nation were established \"exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity\". They stated that although equal civil and political rights applied to all white men, they did not apply to those of the \"African race\", further opining that the end of racial enslavement would \"bring inevitable calamities upon both [races] and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding states\".[56]\\n', '\\nAlabama did not provide a separate declaration of causes. Instead, the ordinance stated ', 'the election of Abraham Lincoln\\xa0... by a sectional party, avowedly hostile to the domestic institutions and to the peace and security of the people of the State of Alabama, preceded by many and dangerous infractions of the Constitution of the United States by many of the States and people of the northern section, is a political wrong of so insulting and menacing a character as to justify the people of the State of Alabama in the adoption of prompt and decided measures for their future peace and security.[57]', 'The secession ordinances of the remaining two states, Florida and Louisiana, simply declared their severing ties with the Union, without stating causes.[58][59] Afterward, the Florida secession convention formed a committee to draft a declaration of causes, but the committee was discharged before completion.[60] Only an undated, untitled draft remains.[61]\\n', \"\\nFour of the Upper South states (Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina) rejected secession until after the clash at Sumter.[62][63][64] Virginia's ordinance stated a kinship with the slave-holding states of the Lower South, but did not name the institution itself as a primary reason.[65] Arkansas's secession ordinance encompassed an objection to the use of military force to preserve the Union as its motivating reason.[66] Before the war, the Arkansas Convention had on March 20 given as their first resolution: \", 'The people of the Northern States have organized a political party, purely sectional in its character, the central and controlling idea of which is hostility to the institution of African slavery, as it exists in the Southern States; and that party has elected a President ... pledged to administer the Government upon principles inconsistent with the rights and subversive of the interests of the Southern States.[67]', 'North Carolina and Tennessee limited their ordinances to simply withdrawing, although Tennessee made clear they wished to make no comment on the \"abstract doctrine of secession\".[68][69] To the Confederate Congress on April 29, 1861, Jefferson Davis cited both the tariff[70] and slavery for the South\\'s secession.[71]\\n', 'Secessionists and conventions', 'The pro-slavery \"Fire-Eaters\" group of Southern Democrats, calling for immediate secession, were opposed by two factions. \"Cooperationists\" in the Deep South would delay secession until several states left the union, perhaps in a Southern Convention. Under the influence of men such as Texas Governor Sam Houston, delay would have the effect of sustaining the Union.[72] \"Unionists\", especially in the Border South, often former Whigs, appealed to sentimental attachment to the United States. Southern Unionists\\' favorite presidential candidate was John Bell of Tennessee, sometimes running under an \"Opposition Party\" banner.[72]\\n', 'Many secessionists were active politically. Governor William Henry Gist of South Carolina corresponded secretly with other Deep South governors, and most southern governors exchanged clandestine commissioners.[73] Charleston\\'s secessionist \"1860 Association\" published over 200,000 pamphlets to persuade the youth of the South. The most influential were: \"The Doom of Slavery\" and \"The South Alone Should Govern the South\", both by John Townsend of South Carolina; and James D. B. De Bow\\'s \"The Interest of Slavery of the Southern Non-slaveholder\".[74]\\n', 'Developments in South Carolina started a chain of events. The foreman of a jury refused the legitimacy of federal courts, so Federal Judge Andrew Magrath ruled that U.S. judicial authority in South Carolina was vacated. A mass meeting in Charleston celebrating the Charleston and Savannah railroad and state cooperation led to the South Carolina legislature to call for a Secession Convention.[75]\\n', 'Elections for Secessionist conventions were heated to \"an almost raving pitch, no one dared dissent\", according to historian William W. Freehling. Even once–respected voices, including the Chief Justice of South Carolina, John Belton O\\'Neall, lost election to the Secession Convention on a Cooperationist ticket. Across the South mobs expelled Yankees and, in Texas, executed German-Americans suspected of loyalty to the United States.[76] Generally, seceding conventions did not call for a referendum, although Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Virginia\\'s second convention did. Kentucky declared neutrality, while Missouri had its own civil war until the Unionists took power and drove Confederate legislators out of the state.[77]\\n', 'Attempts to thwart secession', 'In February 1861, leading politicians from northern states and border states that had yet to secede met in Washington, for the Peace Conference of 1861. Attendees rejected the Crittenden Compromise and other proposals. It proposed the Corwin Amendment to the Congress to bring the seceding states back and convince the border slave states to remain.[78] It was a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution by Ohio Congressman Thomas Corwin that would shield \"domestic institutions\" [e.g. slavery] of the states from the constitutional amendment process, and from abolition or interference by Congress.[79][80]\\n', 'It was passed by the 36th Congress on March 2, 1861. The House approved it by a vote of 133 to 65 and the United States Senate adopted it, with no changes, on a vote of 24 to 12. It was then submitted to the state legislatures for ratification.[81] In his inaugural address Lincoln endorsed the proposed amendment.\\n', 'The text was as follows:\\n', 'No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within any State, with the domestic institutions thereof, including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State.', 'Had it been ratified by the required number of states prior to 1865, on its face it would have made institutionalized slavery immune to constitutional amendment and interference by Congress.[82][83]\\n', 'Inauguration and response', 'The first secession state conventions from the Deep South sent representatives to the Montgomery Convention in Alabama, on February 4, 1861. The fundamental documents of government were promulgated, a provisional government was established, and a representative Congress met for the Confederate States of America.[84]\\n', \"The new provisional Confederate President Jefferson Davis issued a call for 100,000 men from the states' militias to defend the newly formed Confederacy.[84] All Federal property was seized, along with gold bullion and coining dies at the U.S. mints in Charlotte, North Carolina; Dahlonega, Georgia; and New Orleans.[84] The Confederate capital was moved from Montgomery to Richmond, Virginia, in May 1861. On February 22, 1862, Davis was inaugurated as president with a term of six years.[85]\\n\", \"The Confederate administration pursued a policy of national territorial integrity, continuing earlier state efforts in 1860–61 to remove U.S. government presence. This included taking possession of U.S. courts, custom houses, post offices, and most notably, arsenals and forts. But after the Confederate attack and capture of Fort Sumter in April 1861, Lincoln called up 75,000 of the states' militia to muster under his command. The stated purpose was to re-occupy U.S. properties throughout the South, as the U.S. Congress had not authorized their abandonment. The resistance at Fort Sumter signaled his change of policy from that of the Buchanan Administration. Lincoln's response ignited a firestorm of emotion. The people of both North and South demanded war, with soldiers rushing to their colors in the hundreds of thousands.[84]\\n\", 'Secession', 'Secessionists argued that the United States Constitution was a contract among sovereign states that could be abandoned without consultation and each state had a right to secede. After intense debates and statewide votes, seven Deep South cotton states passed secession ordinances by February 1861, while secession efforts failed in the other eight slave states. Unionist talk of reunion failed and Davis began raising a 100,000-man army.[86]\\n', 'States', 'Initially, some secessionists hoped for a peaceful departure. Moderates in the Confederate Constitutional Convention included a provision against importation of slaves from Africa to appeal to the Upper South. Non-slave states might join, but the radicals secured a two-thirds requirement in both houses of Congress to accept them.[87]\\n', \"Seven states declared their secession from the United States before Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861. After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter April 12, 1861, and Lincoln's subsequent call for troops, four more states declared their secession.\\n\", 'Kentucky declared neutrality, but after Confederate troops moved in, the state legislature asked for Union troops to drive them out. Delegates from 68 Kentucky counties were sent to the Russellville Convention that signed an Ordinance of Secession. Kentucky was admitted into the Confederacy on December 10, 1861, with Bowling Green as its first capital. Early in the war, the Confederacy controlled more than half of Kentucky but largely lost control in 1862. The splinter Confederate government of Kentucky relocated to accompany western Confederate armies and never controlled the state population after 1862. By the end of the war, 90,000 Kentuckians had fought for the Union, compared to 35,000 for the Confederacy.[88]\\n', 'In Missouri, a constitutional convention was approved and delegates elected. The convention rejected secession 89–1 on March 19, 1861.[89] The governor maneuvered to take control of the St. Louis Arsenal and restrict Federal movements. This led to a confrontation, and in June federal forces drove him and the General Assembly from Jefferson City. The executive committee of the convention called the members together in July, and declared the state offices vacant and appointed a Unionist interim state government.[90] The exiled governor called a rump session of the former General Assembly together in Neosho and, on October 31, 1861, it passed an ordinance of secession.[91][92] The Confederate state government was unable to control substantial parts of Missouri territory, effectively only controlling southern Missouri early in the war. It had its capital at Neosho, then Cassville, before being driven out of the state. For the remainder of the war, it operated as a government in exile at Marshall, Texas.[93]\\n', \"Not having seceded, neither Kentucky nor Missouri was declared in rebellion in Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. The Confederacy recognized the pro-Confederate claimants in Kentucky (December 10, 1861) and Missouri (November 28, 1861) and laid claim to those states, granting them Congressional representation and adding two stars to the Confederate flag. Voting for the representatives was mostly done by Confederate soldiers from Kentucky and Missouri.[94]\\n\", 'Some southern unionists blamed Lincoln\\'s call for troops as the precipitating event for the second wave of secessions. Historian James McPherson argues such claims have \"a self-serving quality\" and regards them as misleading:\\n', 'As the telegraph chattered reports of the attack on Sumter April 12 and its surrender next day, huge crowds poured into the streets of Richmond, Raleigh, Nashville, and other upper South cities to celebrate this victory over the Yankees. These crowds waved Confederate flags and cheered the glorious cause of southern independence. They demanded that their own states join the cause. Scores of demonstrations took place from April 12 to 14, before Lincoln issued his call for troops. Many conditional unionists were swept along by this powerful tide of southern nationalism; others were cowed into silence.[95]', 'Historian Daniel W. Crofts disagrees with McPherson:\\n', 'The bombardment of Fort Sumter, by itself, did not destroy Unionist majorities in the upper South. Because only three days elapsed before Lincoln issued the proclamation, the two events viewed retrospectively, appear almost simultaneous. Nevertheless, close examination of contemporary evidence\\xa0... shows that the proclamation had a far more decisive impact.[96]...Many concluded\\xa0... that Lincoln had deliberately chosen \"to drive off all the Slave states, in order to make war on them and annihilate slavery\".[97]', 'The order of secession resolutions and dates are:\\n', \"1.

North Carolina (May 20)[109]', 'In Virginia, the populous counties along the Ohio and Pennsylvania borders rejected the Confederacy. Unionists held a Convention in Wheeling in June 1861, establishing a \"restored government\" with a rump legislature, but sentiment in the region remained deeply divided. In the 50 counties that would make up the state of West Virginia, voters from 24 counties had voted for disunion in Virginia\\'s May 23 referendum on the ordinance of secession.[110] In the 1860 election \"Constitutional Democrat\" Breckenridge had outpolled \"Constitutional Unionist\" Bell in the 50 counties by 1,900 votes, 44% to 42%.[111] The counties simultaneously supplied over 20,000 soldiers to each side of the conflict.[112][113] Representatives for most counties were seated in both state legislatures at Wheeling and at Richmond for the duration of the war.[114]\\n', 'Attempts to secede from the Confederacy by counties in East Tennessee were checked by martial law.[115] Although slaveholding Delaware and Maryland did not secede, citizens exhibited divided loyalties. Regiments of Marylanders fought in Lee\\'s Army of Northern Virginia.[116] Overall, 24,000 men from Maryland joined Confederate forces, compared to 63,000 who joined Union forces.[88] Delaware never produced a full regiment for the Confederacy, but neither did it emancipate slaves as did Missouri and West Virginia. District of Columbia citizens made no attempts to secede and through the war, referendums sponsored by  Lincoln approved compensated emancipation and slave confiscation from \"disloyal citizens\".[117]\\n', 'Territories', \"Citizens at Mesilla and Tucson in the southern part of New Mexico Territory formed a secession convention, which voted to join the Confederacy on March 16, 1861, and appointed Dr. Lewis S. Owings as the new territorial governor. They won the Battle of Mesilla and established a territorial government with Mesilla serving as its capital.[118] The Confederacy proclaimed the Confederate Arizona Territory on February 14, 1862, north to the 34th parallel. Marcus H. MacWillie served in both Confederate Congresses as Arizona's delegate. In 1862, the Confederate New Mexico campaign to take the northern half of the U.S. territory failed and the Confederate territorial government in exile relocated to San Antonio, Texas.[119]\\n\", 'Confederate supporters in the trans-Mississippi west claimed portions of the Indian Territory after the US evacuated the federal forts and installations. Over half of the American Indian troops participating in the War from the Indian Territory supported the Confederacy. On July 12, 1861, the Confederate government signed a treaty with both the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indian nations. After several battles, Union armies took control of the territory.[120]\\n', 'The Indian Territory never formally joined the Confederacy, but did receive representation in the Congress. Many Indians from the Territory were integrated into regular Confederate Army units. After 1863, the tribal governments sent representatives to the Confederate Congress: Elias Cornelius Boudinot representing the Cherokee and Samuel Benton Callahan representing the Seminole and Creek. The Cherokee Nation aligned with the Confederacy. They practiced and supported slavery, opposed abolition, and feared their lands would be seized by the Union. After the war, the Indian territory was disestablished, their black slaves were freed, and the tribes lost some of their lands.[121]\\n', 'Capitals', 'Montgomery, Alabama, served as capital of the Confederate States from February 4 until May 29, 1861, in the Alabama State Capitol. Six states created the Confederacy there on February 8, 1861. The Texas delegation was seated at the time, so it is counted in the \"original seven\" states of the Confederacy; it had no roll call vote until after its referendum made secession \"operative\".[122][123] The Permanent Constitution was adopted there on March 12, 1861.[124]\\n', 'The permanent capital provided for in the Confederate Constitution called for a state cession of a 100 square mile district to the central government. Atlanta, which had not yet supplanted Milledgeville, Georgia, as its state capital, put in a bid noting its central location and rail connections, as did Opelika, Alabama, noting its strategically interior situation, rail connections and deposits of coal and iron.[125]\\n', 'Richmond, Virginia, was chosen for the interim capital at the Virginia State Capitol. The move was used by Vice President Stephens and others to encourage other border states to follow Virginia into the Confederacy. In the political moment it was a show of \"defiance and strength\". The war for Southern independence was surely to be fought in Virginia, but it also had the largest Southern military-aged white population, with infrastructure, resources, and supplies. The Davis Administration\\'s policy was that \"It must be held at all hazards.\"[126]\\n', \"The naming of Richmond as the new capital took place on May 30, 1861, and the last two sessions of the Provisional Congress were held there.[127] As war dragged on, Richmond became crowded with training and transfers, logistics and hospitals. Prices rose dramatically despite government efforts at price regulation. A movement in Congress argued for moving the capital from Richmond. At the approach of Federal armies in mid-1862, the government's archives were readied for removal. As the Wilderness Campaign progressed, Congress authorized Davis to remove the executive department and call Congress to session elsewhere in 1864 and again in 1865. Shortly before the end of the war, the Confederate government evacuated Richmond, planning to relocate further south. Little came of these plans before Lee's surrender.[128] Davis and most of his cabinet fled to Danville, Virginia, which served as their headquarters for eight days.\\n\", 'Diplomacy', 'United States, a foreign power', 'During its four years, the Confederacy asserted its independence and appointed dozens of diplomatic agents abroad. None were recognized by a foreign government. The US government regarded the Southern states as being in rebellion or insurrection and so refused any formal recognition of their status.\\n', 'Even before Fort Sumter, U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward issued formal instructions to the American minister to Britain, Charles Francis Adams:\\n', '[Make] no expressions of harshness or disrespect, or even impatience concerning the seceding States, their agents, or their people, [those States] must always continue to be, equal and honored members of this Federal Union, [their citizens] still are and always must be our kindred and countrymen.[129]', 'Seward instructed Adams that if the British government seemed inclined to recognize the Confederacy, or even waver in that regard, it was to receive a sharp warning, with a strong hint of war:\\n', '[if Britain is] tolerating the application of the so-called seceding States, or wavering about it, [they cannot] remain friends with the United States\\xa0... if they determine to recognize [the Confederacy], [Britain] may at the same time prepare to enter into alliance with the enemies of this republic.[129]', 'The US government never declared war on those \"kindred and countrymen\" in the Confederacy but conducted its military efforts beginning with a presidential proclamation issued April 15, 1861.[130] It called for troops to recapture forts and suppress what Lincoln later called an \"insurrection and rebellion\".[131] Mid-war parleys between the two sides occurred without formal political recognition, though the laws of war predominantly governed military relationships on both sides of uniformed conflict.[132]\\n', \"Concerning the international status and nationhood of the Confederate States of America, in 1869 the United States Supreme Court in Texas v. White, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 700 (1869) ruled Texas' declaration of secession was legally null and void.[133] Jefferson Davis and Alexander H. Stephens both wrote postwar arguments in favor of secession's legality and the international legitimacy of the Government of the Confederate States of America, most notably Davis' The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government.\\n\", 'International diplomacy', 'Once war with the United States began, the Confederacy pinned its hopes for survival on military intervention by the UK or France. The Confederate government sent James M. Mason to London and John Slidell to Paris. On their way in 1861, the U.S. Navy intercepted their ship, the Trent, and took them to Boston, an international episode known as the Trent Affair. The diplomats were eventually released and continued their voyage.[134] However, their mission was unsuccessful; historians judge their diplomacy as poor.[135][page\\xa0needed] Neither secured diplomatic recognition for the Confederacy, much less military assistance.\\n', 'The Confederates who had believed that \"cotton is king\", that is, that Britain had to support the Confederacy to obtain cotton, proved mistaken. The British had stocks to last over a year and been developing alternative sources, notably India and from the Ottomans in Egypt. Indeed, in 1861 Britain had so much cotton it was exporting excess to France.[136] Britain was not concerned over Confederate cotton, particularly while  food trade with the North was at jeopardy, and war becoming a more plausible risk.[137][page\\xa0needed][138]\\n', 'Aside from economics, there was also an ethical debate. The United Kingdom took pride leading the end of transatlantic enslavement of Africans, phasing the practice out within its empire from 1807. By 1833, the Royal Navy patrolled middle passage waters to prevent additional slave ships from reaching the Western Hemisphere. Confederate diplomats found little support for slavery, cotton trade or not. Slave narratives about American slavery were being published in London.[139] It was in London that the first World Anti-Slavery Convention had been held in 1840. Black abolitionist speakers toured England, Scotland, and Ireland. In addition to exposing the reality of America\\'s chattel slavery—some were fugitive slaves—they rebutted the Confederate position that blacks were \"unintellectual, timid, and dependent\",[140] and \"not equal to the white man...the superior race.\" Frederick Douglass, Henry Highland Garnet, Sarah Parker Remond, her brother Charles Lenox Remond, James W. C. Pennington, Martin Delany, Samuel Ringgold Ward, and William G. Allen all spent years in Britain, where fugitive slaves were safe and, as Allen said, there was an \"absence of prejudice against color. Here the colored man feels himself among friends, and not among enemies\".[141] One speaker alone, William Wells Brown, gave more than 1,000 lectures on the shame of American chattel slavery.[142]:\\u200a32\\u200a Most British public opinion was against the practice, with Liverpool seen as the primary base of Southern support.[143]\\n', \"Throughout the early years of the war, British foreign secretary Lord John Russell, Emperor Napoleon III of France, and, to a lesser extent, British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston, showed interest in recognition of the Confederacy or at least mediation of the war. Chancellor of the Exchequer William Gladstone, convinced of the necessity of intervention on the Confederate side based on the successful diplomatic intervention in the Second Italian War of Independence against Austria, attempted unsuccessfully to convince Palmerston to intervene.[144] By September 1862 the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam, Lincoln's preliminary Emancipation Proclamation and abolitionist opposition in Britain put an end to these possibilities.[145] The cost to Britain of a war with the U.S. would have been high: the immediate loss of American grain-shipments, the end of British exports to the U.S., and seizure of billions of pounds invested in American securities. War would have meant higher taxes in Britain, another invasion of Canada, and attacks on the British merchant fleet. In mid-1862, fears of a race war (like the Haitian Revolution of 1791–1804) led to the British considering intervention for humanitarian reasons.[146]\\n\", \"John Slidell, the Confederate States emissary to France, succeeded in negotiating a loan of $15,000,000 from Erlanger and other French capitalists. The money went to buy ironclad warships, and military supplies.[147] The British government did allow the construction of blockade runners in Britain; they were owned and operated by British financiers and shipowners; a few were owned and operated by the Confederacy. The British investors' goal was to acquire highly profitable cotton.[148]\\n\", 'Several European nations maintained diplomats in place who had been appointed to the U.S., but no country appointed any diplomat to the Confederacy. Those nations recognized the Union and Confederate sides as belligerents. In 1863, the Confederacy expelled European diplomatic missions for advising their resident subjects to refuse to serve in the Confederate army.[149] Both Confederate and Union agents were allowed to work openly in British territories.[150] The Confederacy appointed Ambrose Dudley Mann as special agent to the Holy See in September 1863, but the Holy See never released a statement supporting or recognizing the Confederacy. In November 1863, Mann met Pope Pius IX and received a letter supposedly addressed \"to the Illustrious and Honorable Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America\"; Mann had mistranslated the address. In his report to Richmond, Mann claimed a great diplomatic achievement for himself, asserting the letter was \"a positive recognition of our Government\". The letter was indeed used in propaganda, but Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin told Mann it was \"a mere inferential recognition, unconnected with political action or the regular establishment of diplomatic relations\" and thus did not assign it the weight of formal recognition.[151][152]\\n', 'Nevertheless, the Confederacy was seen internationally as a serious attempt at nationhood, and European governments sent military observers to assess whether there had been a de facto establishment of independence. These observers included Arthur Lyon Fremantle of the British Coldstream Guards, who entered the Confederacy via Mexico, Fitzgerald Ross of the Austrian Hussars, and Justus Scheibert of the Prussian Army.[153] European travelers visited and wrote accounts for publication. Importantly in 1862, the Frenchman Charles Girard\\'s Seven months in the rebel states during the North American War testified \"this government ... is no longer a trial government ... but really a normal government, the expression of popular will\".[154] Fremantle went on to write in his book Three Months in the Southern States that he had:\\n', '...not attempted to conceal any of the peculiarities or defects of the Southern people. Many persons will doubtless highly disapprove of some of their customs and habits in the wilder portion of the country; but I think no generous man, whatever may be his political opinions, can do otherwise than admire the courage, energy, and patriotism of the whole population, and the skill of its leaders, in this struggle against great odds. And I am also of opinion that many will agree with me in thinking that a people in which all ranks and both sexes display a unanimity and a heroism which can never have been surpassed in the history of the world, is destined, sooner or later, to become a great and independent nation.[155]', 'French Emperor Napoleon III assured Confederate diplomat John Slidell that he would make \"direct proposition\" to Britain for joint recognition. The Emperor made the same assurance to British Members of Parliament John A. Roebuck and John A. Lindsay. Roebuck in turn publicly prepared a bill to submit to Parliament supporting joint Anglo-French recognition of the Confederacy. \"Southerners had a right to be optimistic, or at least hopeful, that their revolution would prevail, or at least endure.\"<\"Thomas2011\" pp=219–221</ref> Following the  disasters at Vicksburg and Gettysburg in July 1863, the Confederates \"suffered a severe loss of confidence in themselves\" and withdrew into an interior defensive position. There would be no help from the Europeans.[156]\\n', 'By December 1864, Davis considered sacrificing slavery in order to enlist recognition and aid from Paris and London; he secretly sent Duncan F. Kenner to Europe with a message that the war was fought solely for \"the vindication of our rights to self-government and independence\" and that \"no sacrifice is too great, save that of honor\". The message stated that if the French or British governments made their recognition conditional on anything at all, the Confederacy would consent to such terms.[157] Davis\\'s message could not explicitly acknowledge that slavery was on the bargaining table due to still-strong domestic support for slavery among the wealthy and politically influential. European leaders all saw that the Confederacy was on the verge of defeat.[158]\\n', 'Brazil and Cuba', 'The Confederacy\\'s biggest foreign policy successes were with Brazil and Cuba. Militarily this meant little. Brazil represented the \"peoples most identical to us in Institutions\",[159] in which slavery remained legal until the 1880s and the abolitionist movement was small. Confederate ships were welcome in Brazilian ports.[160] After the war, Brazil was the primary destination of those Southerners who wanted to continue living in a slave society, where, as one immigrant remarked, Confederado slaves were cheap.\\n', 'Cuba was a Spanish colony and the Captain–General of Cuba declared in writing that Confederate ships were welcome, and would be protected in Cuban ports.[159]  Historians speculate that if the Confederacy had achieved independence, it probably would have tried to acquire Cuba as a base of expansion.[161]\\n', 'Confederacy at war', 'Motivations of soldiers', 'Most soldiers who joined Confederate national or state military units joined voluntarily. Perman (2010) says historians are of two minds on why millions of soldiers seemed so eager to fight, suffer and die over four years:\\n', \"Some historians emphasize that Civil War soldiers were driven by political ideology, holding firm beliefs about the importance of liberty, Union, or state rights, or about the need to protect or to destroy slavery. Others point to less overtly political reasons to fight, such as the defense of one's home and family, or the honor and brotherhood to be preserved when fighting alongside other men. Most historians agree that, no matter what he thought about when he went into the war, the experience of combat affected him profoundly and sometimes affected his reasons for continuing to fight.[162][163]\", 'Military strategy', 'Civil War historian E. Merton Coulter wrote that for those who would secure its independence, \"The Confederacy was unfortunate in its failure to work out a general strategy for the whole war\". Aggressive strategy called for offensive force concentration. Defensive strategy sought dispersal to meet demands of locally minded governors. The controlling philosophy evolved into a combination \"dispersal with a defensive concentration around Richmond\". The Davis administration considered the war purely defensive, a \"simple demand that the people of the United States would cease to war upon us\".[164] Historian James M. McPherson is a critic of Lee\\'s offensive strategy: \"Lee pursued a faulty military strategy that ensured Confederate defeat\".[165]\\n', 'As the Confederate government lost control of territory in campaign after campaign, it was said that \"the vast size of the Confederacy would make its conquest impossible\". The enemy would be struck down by the same elements which so often debilitated or destroyed visitors and transplants in the South. Heat exhaustion, sunstroke, endemic diseases such as malaria and typhoid would match the destructive effectiveness of the Moscow winter on the invading armies of Napoleon.[166]\\n', 'Early in the war, both sides believed that one great battle would decide the conflict; the Confederates won a surprise victory at the First Battle of Bull Run, also known as First Manassas (the name used by Confederate forces). It drove the Confederate people \"insane with joy\"; the public demanded a forward movement to capture Washington, relocate the Confederate capital there, and admit Maryland to the Confederacy.[167] A council of war by the victorious Confederate generals decided not to advance against larger numbers of fresh Federal troops in defensive positions. Davis did not countermand it. Following the Confederate incursion into Maryland halted at the Battle of Antietam in October 1862, generals proposed concentrating forces from state commands to re-invade the north. Nothing came of it.[168] Again in mid-1863 at his incursion into Pennsylvania, Lee requested of Davis that Beauregard simultaneously attack Washington with troops taken from the Carolinas. But the troops there remained in place during the Gettysburg Campaign.\\n', 'The eleven states of the Confederacy were outnumbered by the North about four-to-one in military manpower. It was overmatched far more in military equipment, industrial facilities, railroads for transport, and wagons supplying the front.\\n', 'Confederates slowed the Yankee invaders, at heavy cost to the Southern infrastructure. The Confederates burned bridges, laid land mines in the roads, and made harbors inlets and inland waterways unusable with sunken mines (called \"torpedoes\" at the time). Coulter reports:\\n', 'Rangers in twenty to fifty-man units were awarded 50% valuation for property destroyed behind Union lines, regardless of location or loyalty. As Federals occupied the South, objections by loyal Confederate concerning Ranger horse-stealing and indiscriminate scorched earth tactics behind Union lines led to Congress abolishing the Ranger service two years later.[169]', 'The Confederacy relied on external sources for war materials. The first came from trade with the enemy. \"Vast amounts of war supplies\" came through Kentucky, and thereafter, western armies were \"to a very considerable extent\" provisioned with illicit trade via Federal agents and northern private traders.[170] But that trade was interrupted in the first year of war by Admiral Porter\\'s river gunboats as they gained dominance along navigable rivers north–south and east–west.[171] Overseas blockade running then came to be of \"outstanding importance\".[172] On April 17, President Davis called on privateer raiders, the \"militia of the sea\", to wage war on U.S. seaborne commerce.[173] Despite noteworthy effort, over the course of the war the Confederacy was found unable to match the Union in ships and seamanship, materials and marine construction.[174]\\n', 'An inescapable obstacle to success in the warfare of mass armies was the Confederacy\\'s lack of manpower, and sufficient numbers of disciplined, equipped troops in the field at the point of contact with the enemy. During the winter of 1862–63, Lee observed that none of his famous victories had resulted in the destruction of the opposing army. He lacked reserve troops to exploit an advantage on the battlefield as Napoleon had done. Lee explained, \"More than once have most promising opportunities been lost for want of men to take advantage of them, and victory itself had been made to put on the appearance of defeat, because our diminished and exhausted troops have been unable to renew a successful struggle against fresh numbers of the enemy.\"[175]\\n', 'Armed forces', 'The military armed forces of the Confederacy comprised three branches: Army, Navy and Marine Corps.\\n', 'The Confederate military leadership included many veterans from the United States Army and United States Navy who had resigned their Federal commissions and were appointed to senior positions. Many had served in the Mexican–American War (including Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis), but some such as Leonidas Polk (who graduated from West Point but did not serve in the Army) had little or no experience.\\n', \"The Confederate officer corps consisted of men from both slave-owning and non-slave-owning families. The Confederacy appointed junior and field grade officers by election from the enlisted ranks. Although no Army service academy was established for the Confederacy, some colleges (such as The Citadel and Virginia Military Institute) maintained cadet corps that trained Confederate military leadership. A naval academy was established at Drewry's Bluff, Virginia[176] in 1863, but no midshipmen graduated before the Confederacy's end.\\n\", 'Most soldiers were white males aged between 16 and 28. The median year of birth was 1838, so half the soldiers were 23 or older by 1861.[177]  The Confederate Army was permitted to disband for two months in early 1862 after its short-term enlistments expired. The majority of those in uniform would not re-enlist after their one-year commitment, thus on April 16, 1862, the Confederate Congress imposed the first mass conscription on North American territory. (A year later, on March 3, 1863, the United States Congress passed the Enrollment Act.) Rather than a universal draft, the first program was a selective one with physical, religious, professional, and industrial exemptions. These became narrower as the battle progressed Initially substitutes were permitted, but by December 1863 these were disallowed. In September 1862 the age limit was increased from 35 to 45 and by February 1864, all men under 18 and over 45 were conscripted to form a reserve for state defense inside state borders. By March 1864, the Superintendent of Conscription reported that all across the Confederacy, every officer in constituted authority, man and woman, \"engaged in opposing the enrolling officer in the execution of his duties\".[178] Although challenged in the state courts, the Confederate State Supreme Courts routinely rejected legal challenges to conscription.[179]\\n', 'Many thousands of slaves served as personal servants to their owner, or were hired as laborers, cooks, and pioneers.[180] Some freed blacks and men of color served in local state militia units of the Confederacy, primarily in Louisiana and South Carolina, but their officers deployed them for \"local defense, not combat\".[181] Depleted by casualties and desertions, the military suffered chronic manpower shortages. In early 1865, the Confederate Congress, influenced by the public support by General Lee, approved the recruitment of black infantry units. Contrary to Lee\\'s and Davis\\'s recommendations, the Congress refused \"to guarantee the freedom of black volunteers\". No more than two hundred black combat troops were ever raised.[182]\\n', 'Raising troops', 'The immediate onset of war meant that it was fought by the \"Provisional\" or \"Volunteer Army\". State governors resisted concentrating a national effort. Several wanted a strong state army for self-defense. Others feared large \"Provisional\" armies answering only to Davis.[183] When filling the Confederate government\\'s call for 100,000 men, another 200,000 were turned away by accepting only those enlisted \"for the duration\" or twelve-month volunteers who brought their own arms or horses.[184]\\n', 'It was important to raise troops; it was just as important to provide capable officers to command them. With few exceptions the Confederacy secured excellent general officers. Efficiency in the lower officers was \"greater than could have been reasonably expected\". As with the Federals, political appointees could be indifferent. Otherwise, the officer corps was governor-appointed or elected by unit enlisted. Promotion to fill vacancies was made internally regardless of merit, even if better officers were immediately available.[185]\\n', 'Anticipating the need for more \"duration\" men, in January 1862 Congress provided for company level recruiters to return home for two months, but their efforts met little success on the heels of Confederate battlefield defeats in February.[186] Congress allowed for Davis to require numbers of recruits from each governor to supply the volunteer shortfall. States responded by passing their own draft laws.[187]\\n', 'The veteran Confederate army of early 1862 was mostly twelve-month volunteers with terms about to expire. Enlisted reorganization elections disintegrated the army for two months. Officers pleaded with the ranks to re-enlist, but a majority did not. Those remaining elected majors and colonels whose performance led to officer review boards in October. The boards caused a \"rapid and widespread\" thinning out of 1,700 incompetent officers. Troops thereafter would elect only second lieutenants.[188]\\n', 'In early 1862, the popular press suggested the Confederacy required a million men under arms. But veteran soldiers were not re-enlisting, and earlier secessionist volunteers did not reappear to serve in war. One Macon, Georgia, newspaper asked how two million brave fighting men of the South were about to be overcome by four million northerners who were said to be cowards.[189]\\n', 'Conscription', 'The Confederacy passed the first American law of national conscription on April 16, 1862. The white males of the Confederate States from 18 to 35 were declared members of the Confederate army for three years, and all men then enlisted were extended to a three-year term. They would serve only in units and under officers of their state. Those under 18 and over 35 could substitute for conscripts, in September those from 35 to 45 became conscripts.[190] The cry of \"rich man\\'s war and a poor man\\'s fight\" led Congress to abolish the substitute system altogether in December 1863. All principals benefiting earlier were made eligible for service. By February 1864, the age bracket was made 17 to 50, those under eighteen and over forty-five to be limited to in-state duty.[191]\\n', 'Confederate conscription was not universal; it was a selective service. The First Conscription Act of April 1862 exempted occupations related to transportation, communication, industry, ministers, teaching and physical fitness. The Second Conscription Act of October 1862 expanded exemptions in industry, agriculture and conscientious objection. Exemption fraud proliferated in medical examinations, army furloughs, churches, schools, apothecaries and newspapers.[192]\\n', 'Rich men\\'s sons were appointed to the socially outcast \"overseer\" occupation, but the measure was received in the country with \"universal odium\". The legislative vehicle was the controversial Twenty Negro Law that specifically exempted one white overseer or owner for every plantation with at least 20 slaves. Backpedaling six months later, Congress provided overseers under 45 could be exempted only if they held the occupation before the first Conscription Act.[193] The number of officials under state exemptions appointed by state Governor patronage expanded significantly.[194] By law, substitutes could not be subject to conscription, but instead of adding to Confederate manpower, unit officers in the field reported that over-50 and under-17-year-old substitutes made up to 90% of the desertions.[195]\\n', 'The Conscription Act of February 1864 \"radically changed the whole system\" of selection. It abolished industrial exemptions, placing detail authority in President Davis. As the shame of conscription was greater than a felony conviction, the system brought in \"about as many volunteers as it did conscripts.\" Many men in otherwise \"bombproof\" positions were enlisted in one way or another, nearly 160,000 additional volunteers and conscripts in uniform. Still there was shirking.[197] To administer the draft, a Bureau of Conscription was set up to use state officers, as state Governors would allow. It had a checkered career of \"contention, opposition and futility\". Armies appointed alternative military \"recruiters\" to bring in the out-of-uniform 17–50-year-old conscripts and deserters. Nearly 3,000 officers were tasked with the job. By late 1864, Lee was calling for more troops. \"Our ranks are constantly diminishing by battle and disease, and few recruits are received; the consequences are inevitable.\" By March 1865 conscription was to be administered by generals of the state reserves calling out men over 45 and under 18 years old. All exemptions were abolished. These regiments were assigned to recruit conscripts ages 17–50, recover deserters, and repel enemy cavalry raids. The service retained men who had lost but one arm or a leg in home guards. Ultimately, conscription was a failure, and its main value was in goading men to volunteer.[198]\\n', 'The survival of the Confederacy depended on a strong base of civilians and soldiers devoted to victory. The soldiers performed well, though increasing numbers deserted in the last year of fighting, and the Confederacy never succeeded in replacing casualties as the Union could. The civilians, although enthusiastic in 1861–62, seem to have lost faith in the future of the Confederacy by 1864, and instead looked to protect their homes and communities. As Rable explains, \"This contraction of civic vision was more than a crabbed libertarianism; it represented an increasingly widespread disillusionment with the Confederate experiment.\"[199]\\n', 'Victories: 1861', 'The American Civil War broke out in April 1861 with a Confederate victory at the Battle of Fort Sumter in Charleston.\\n', 'In January, President James Buchanan had attempted to resupply the garrison with the steamship, Star of the West, but Confederate artillery drove it away. In March, President Lincoln notified South Carolina Governor Pickens that without Confederate resistance to the resupply there would be no military reinforcement without further notice, but Lincoln prepared to force resupply if it were not allowed. Confederate President Davis, in cabinet, decided to seize Fort Sumter before the relief fleet arrived, and on April 12, 1861, General Beauregard forced its surrender.[201]\\n', \"Following Sumter, Lincoln directed states to provide 75,000 troops for three months to recapture the Charleston Harbor forts and all other federal property.[202] This emboldened secessionists in Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina to secede rather than provide troops to march into neighboring Southern states. In May, Federal troops crossed into Confederate territory along the entire border from the Chesapeake Bay to New Mexico. The first battles were Confederate victories at Big Bethel (Bethel Church, Virginia), First Bull Run (First Manassas) in Virginia July and in August, Wilson's Creek (Oak Hills) in Missouri. At all three, Confederate forces could not follow up their victory due to inadequate supply and shortages of fresh troops to exploit their successes. Following each battle, Federals maintained a military presence and occupied Washington, DC; Fort Monroe, Virginia; and Springfield, Missouri. Both North and South began training up armies for major fighting the next year.[203] Union General George B. McClellan's forces gained possession of much of northwestern Virginia in mid-1861, concentrating on towns and roads; the interior was too large to control and became the center of guerrilla activity.[204][205] General Robert E. Lee was defeated at Cheat Mountain in September and no serious Confederate advance in western Virginia occurred until the next year.\\n\", 'Meanwhile, the Union Navy seized control of much of the Confederate coastline from Virginia to South Carolina. It took over plantations and the abandoned slaves. Federals there began a war-long policy of burning grain supplies up rivers into the interior wherever they could not occupy.[206] The Union Navy began a blockade of the major southern ports and prepared an invasion of Louisiana to capture New Orleans in early 1862.\\n', 'Incursions: 1862', 'The victories of 1861 were followed by a series of defeats east and west in early 1862. To restore the Union by military force, the Federal strategy was to (1) secure the Mississippi River, (2) seize or close Confederate ports, and (3) march on Richmond. To secure independence, the Confederate intent was to (1) repel the invader on all fronts, costing him blood and treasure, and (2) carry the war into the North by two offensives in time to affect the mid-term elections.\\n', 'Much of northwestern Virginia was under Federal control.[208]\\nIn February and March, most of Missouri and Kentucky were Union \"occupied, consolidated, and used as staging areas for advances further South\". Following the repulse of a Confederate counterattack at the Battle of Shiloh, Tennessee, permanent Federal occupation expanded west, south and east.[209] Confederate forces repositioned south along the Mississippi River to Memphis, Tennessee, where at the naval Battle of Memphis, its River Defense Fleet was sunk. Confederates withdrew from northern Mississippi and northern Alabama. New Orleans was captured on April 29 by a combined Army-Navy force under U.S. Admiral David Farragut, and the Confederacy lost control of the mouth of the Mississippi River. It had to concede extensive agricultural resources that had supported the Union\\'s sea-supplied logistics base.[210]\\n', 'Although Confederates had suffered major reverses everywhere, as of the end of April the Confederacy still controlled territory holding 72% of its population.[211] Federal forces disrupted Missouri and Arkansas; they had broken through in western Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Louisiana. Along the Confederacy\\'s shores, Union forces had closed ports and made garrisoned lodgments on every coastal Confederate state except Alabama and Texas.[212] Although scholars sometimes assess the Union blockade as ineffectual under international law until the last few months of the war, from the first months it disrupted Confederate privateers, making it \"almost impossible to bring their prizes into Confederate ports\".[213] British firms developed small fleets of blockade running companies, such as John Fraser and Company and S. Isaac, Campbell & Company while the Ordnance Department secured its own blockade runners for dedicated munitions cargoes.[214]\\n', \"During the Civil War fleets of armored warships were deployed for the first time in sustained blockades at sea. After some success against the Union blockade, in March the ironclad CSS Virginia was forced into port and burned by Confederates at their retreat. Despite several attempts mounted from their port cities, CSA naval forces were unable to break the Union blockade. Attempts were made by Commodore Josiah Tattnall III's ironclads from Savannah in 1862 with the CSS Atlanta.[215] Secretary of the Navy Stephen Mallory placed his hopes in a European-built ironclad fleet, but they were never realized. On the other hand, four new English-built commerce raiders served the Confederacy, and several fast blockade runners were sold in Confederate ports. They were converted into commerce-raiding cruisers, and manned by their British crews.[216]\\n\", \"In the east, Union forces could not close on Richmond. General McClellan landed his army on the Lower Peninsula of Virginia. Lee subsequently ended that threat from the east, then Union General John Pope attacked overland from the north only to be repulsed at Second Bull Run (Second Manassas). Lee's strike north was turned back at Antietam MD, then Union Major General Ambrose Burnside's offensive was disastrously ended at Fredericksburg VA in December. Both armies then turned to winter quarters to recruit and train for the coming spring.[217]\\n\", \"In an attempt to seize the initiative, reprove, protect farms in mid-growing season and influence U.S. Congressional elections, two major Confederate incursions into Union territory had been launched in August and September 1862. Both Braxton Bragg's invasion of Kentucky and Lee's invasion of Maryland were decisively repulsed, leaving Confederates in control of but 63% of its population.[211] Civil War scholar Allan Nevins argues that 1862 was the strategic high-water mark of the Confederacy.[218] The failures of the two invasions were attributed to the same irrecoverable shortcomings: lack of manpower at the front, lack of supplies including serviceable shoes, and exhaustion after long marches without adequate food.[219] Also in September Confederate General William W. Loring pushed Federal forces from Charleston, Virginia, and the Kanawha Valley in western Virginia, but lacking reinforcements Loring abandoned his position and by November the region was back in Federal control.[220][221]\\n\", 'Anaconda: 1863–1864', 'The failed Middle Tennessee campaign was ended January 2, 1863, at the inconclusive Battle of Stones River (Murfreesboro), both sides losing the largest percentage of casualties suffered during the war.

Southern newspapers assessed the campaign as \"The Confederates did not gain a victory, neither did the enemy.\"\\n', \"September and November left Confederates yielding Chattanooga, Tennessee, the gateway to the lower south.[223] For the remainder of the war fighting was restricted inside the South, resulting in a slow but continuous loss of territory. In early 1864, the Confederacy still controlled 53% of its population, but it withdrew further to reestablish defensive positions.

Railroads were captured or had ceased operating. Its major food-producing regions had been war-ravaged or occupied. Its administration survived in only three pockets of territory holding only one-third of its population. Its armies were defeated or disbanding. At the February 1865 Hampton Roads Conference with Lincoln, senior Confederate officials rejected his invitation to restore the Union with compensation for emancipated slaves.[210] The three pockets of unoccupied Confederacy were southern Virginia—North Carolina, central Alabama—Florida, and Texas, the latter two areas less from any notion of resistance than from the disinterest of Federal forces to occupy them.[229] The Davis policy was independence or nothing, while Lee's army was wracked by disease and desertion, barely holding the trenches defending Jefferson Davis' capital.\\n\", 'The Confederacy\\'s last remaining blockade-running port, Wilmington, North Carolina, was lost.

There was a great deal of discussion in 1865 about bringing treason trials, especially against Jefferson Davis. There was no consensus in President Johnson\\'s cabinet, and no one was charged with treason. An acquittal of Davis would have been humiliating for the government.[238]\\n', 'Davis was indicted for treason but never tried; he was released from prison on bail in May 1867.

The charges against him involved conspiracy and cruelty, not treason.\\n', 'The U.S. government began a decade-long process known as Reconstruction which attempted to resolve the political and constitutional issues of the Civil War. The priorities were: to guarantee that Confederate nationalism and slavery were ended, to ratify and enforce the Thirteenth Amendment which outlawed slavery; the Fourteenth which guaranteed dual U.S. and state citizenship to all native-born residents, regardless of race; and the Fifteenth, which made it illegal to deny the right to vote because of race.[242]\\n', 'By 1877, the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction in the former Confederate states. Federal troops were withdrawn from the South, where conservative white Democrats had already regained political control of state governments, often through extreme violence and fraud to suppress black voting. The prewar South had many rich areas; the war left the entire region economically devastated by military action, ruined infrastructure, and exhausted resources. Still dependent on an agricultural economy and resisting investment in infrastructure, it remained dominated by the planter elite into the next century. Confederate veterans had been temporarily disenfranchised by Reconstruction policy, and Democrat-dominated legislatures passed new constitutions and amendments to now exclude most blacks and many poor whites. This exclusion and a weakened Republican Party remained the norm until the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The Solid South of the early 20th century did not achieve national levels of prosperity until long after World War II.[243]\\n', 'Texas v. White (1869)', 'In Texas v. White, the United States Supreme Court ruled—by a 5–3 majority—that Texas had remained a state ever since it first joined the Union, despite claims that it joined the Confederate States of America. In this case, the court held that the Constitution did not permit a state to unilaterally secede from the United States. Further, that the ordinances of secession, and all the acts of the legislatures within seceding states intended to give effect to such ordinances, were \"absolutely null\", under the Constitution.[244] This case settled the law that applied to all questions regarding state legislation during the war. Furthermore, it decided one of the \"central constitutional questions\" of the Civil War: The Union is perpetual and indestructible, as a matter of constitutional law. In declaring that no state could leave the Union, \"except through revolution or through consent of the States\", it was \"explicitly repudiating the position of the Confederate states that the United States was a voluntary compact between sovereign states\".[245]\\n', 'Sprott v. United States (1874)', \"In Sprott v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled—by a 8–1 majority—to reaffirm its conclusion in White and held that the Confederate States of America was little more than a briefly-existing breakaway state. Specifically, the opinion would condemn the Confederacy as treasonous and as totally perishing upon being overthrown.[246][247] Writing for the court's majority, Associate Justice Samuel Freeman Miller would remark that:\\n\", '\"It [the Confederacy] had no existence, except as a conspiracy to overthrow lawful authority. Its foundation was treason against the existing Federal government. Its single purpose, so long as it lasted, was to make that treason successful. So far from being necessary to the organization of civil government, or to its maintenance and support, it was inimical to social order, destructive to the best interests of society, and its primary object was to overthrow the government on which these so largely depended. Its existence and temporary power were an enormous evil, which the whole force of the government and the people of the United States was engaged for years in destroying.When it was overthrown it perished totally. It left no laws, no statutes, no decrees, no authority which can give support to any contract, or any act done in its service, or in aid of its purpose, or which contributed to protract its existence.\".', 'Theories regarding downfall', '\"Died of states\\' rights\"', 'Historian Frank Lawrence Owsley argued that the Confederacy \"died of states\\' rights\".[248][249][250] The central government was denied requisitioned soldiers and money by governors and state legislatures because they feared that Richmond would encroach on the rights of the states. Georgia\\'s governor Joseph Brown warned of a secret conspiracy by Jefferson Davis to destroy states\\' rights and individual liberty. The first conscription act in North America, authorizing Davis to draft soldiers, was said to be the \"essence of military despotism\".[251][252] Roger Lowenstein argued in Ways and Means: Lincoln and His Cabinet and the Financing of the Civil War (2022) that the Confederacy\\'s failure to raise adequate revenue led to hyperinflation and being unable to win a war of attrition, despite the prowess of its military leadership such as Robert E. Lee.[253]\\n', 'Vice President Alexander H. Stephens feared losing the very form of republican government. Allowing President Davis to threaten \"arbitrary arrests\" to draft hundreds of governor-appointed \"bomb-proof\" bureaucrats conferred \"more power than the English Parliament had ever bestowed on the king. History proved the dangers of such unchecked authority.\"[254] The abolishment of draft exemptions for newspaper editors was interpreted as an attempt by the Confederate government to muzzle presses, such as the Raleigh NC Standard, to control elections and to suppress the peace meetings there. As Rable concludes, \"For Stephens, the essence of patriotism, the heart of the Confederate cause, rested on an unyielding commitment to traditional rights\" without considerations of military necessity, pragmatism or compromise.[254]\\n', \"In 1863, Governor Pendleton Murrah of Texas determined that state troops were required for defense against Plains Indians and Union forces that might attack from Kansas. He refused to send his soldiers to the East.[255] Governor Zebulon Vance of North Carolina showed intense opposition to conscription, limiting recruitment success. Vance's faith in states' rights drove him into repeated, stubborn opposition to the Davis administration.[256]\\n\", 'Though political differences were within the Confederacy, no national political parties were formed because they were seen as illegitimate. \"Anti-partyism became an article of political faith.\"[257] Without a system of political parties building alternate sets of national leaders, electoral protests tended to be narrowly state-based, \"negative, carping and petty\". The 1863 mid-term elections became mere expressions of futile and frustrated dissatisfaction. According to historian David M. Potter, the lack of a functioning two-party system caused \"real and direct damage\" to the Confederate war effort since it prevented the formulation of any effective alternatives to the conduct of the war by the Davis administration.[258]\\n', '\"Died of Davis\"', 'The enemies of President Davis proposed that the Confederacy \"died of Davis\". He was unfavorably compared to George Washington by critics such as Edward Alfred Pollard, editor of the most influential newspaper in the Confederacy, the Richmond (Virginia) Examiner. Beyond the early honeymoon period, Davis was never popular.[259]\\n', 'E. Merton Coulter, viewed by historians as a Confederate apologist,[260][261][262][263] says Davis was heroic, but his \"tenacity, determination, and will power\" stirred up lasting opposition from enemies. He failed to overcome \"petty leaders of the states\" who made the term \"Confederacy\" into a label for tyranny and oppression, preventing the \"Stars and Bars\" from becoming a symbol of larger patriotic service and sacrifice. Instead of campaigning to develop nationalism and gain support for his administration, he rarely courted public opinion, assuming an aloofness, \"almost like an Adams\".[259]\\n', 'Escott argues that Davis was unable to mobilize Confederate nationalism in support of his government effectively, and especially failed to appeal to the small farmers who comprised the bulk of the population. Escott also emphasizes that the widespread opposition to any strong central government combined with the vast difference in wealth between the slave-owning class and the small farmers created insolvable dilemmas when the Confederate survival presupposed a strong central government backed by a united populace. The prewar claim that white solidarity was necessary to provide a unified Southern voice in Washington no longer held. Davis failed to build a network of supporters who would speak up when he came under criticism, and he repeatedly alienated governors and other state-based leaders by demanding centralized control of the war effort.[264]\\n', 'According to Coulter, Davis was not an efficient administrator as he attended to too many details, protected his friends after their failures were obvious, and spent too much time on military affairs versus his civic responsibilities. Coulter concludes he was not the ideal leader for the Southern Revolution, but he showed \"fewer weaknesses than any other\" contemporary character available for the role.[265]\\n', 'Government and politics', 'Political divisions', 'Constitution', 'In February, 1861, Southern leaders met in Montgomery, Alabama to adopt their first constitution, establishing a confederation of \"sovereign and independent states\", guaranteeing states the right to a republican form of government. Prior to adopting to the first Confederate constitution, the independent states were sovereign republics, e.g. \"Republic of Louisiana\", \"Republic of Mississippi\", \"Republic of Texas\" etc.[4][17]\\n', 'A second Confederate constitution was written in March, 1861, which sought to replace the confederation with a federal government; much of this constitution replicated the United States Constitution verbatim, but contained several explicit protections of the institution of slavery including provisions for the recognition and protection of slavery in any territory of the Confederacy. It maintained the ban on international slave-trading, though it made the ban\\'s application explicit to \"Negroes of the African race\" in contrast to the U.S. Constitution\\'s reference to \"such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit\". It protected the existing internal trade of slaves among slaveholding states.\\n', 'In certain areas, the second Confederate Constitution gave greater powers to the states (or curtailed the powers of the central government more) than the U.S. Constitution of the time did, but in other areas, the states lost rights they had under the U.S. Constitution. Although the Confederate Constitution, like the U.S. Constitution, contained a commerce clause, the Confederate version prohibited the central government from using revenues collected in one state for funding internal improvements in another state. The Confederate Constitution\\'s equivalent to the U.S. Constitution\\'s general welfare clause prohibited protective tariffs (but allowed tariffs for providing domestic revenue), and spoke of \"carry[ing] on the Government of the Confederate States\" rather than providing for the \"general welfare\". State legislatures had the power to impeach officials of the Confederate government in some cases. On the other hand, the Confederate Constitution contained a Necessary and Proper Clause and a Supremacy Clause that essentially duplicated the respective clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The Confederate Constitution also incorporated each of the 12 amendments to the U.S. Constitution that had been ratified up to that point.\\n', 'The second Confederate Constitution was finally adopted on February 22, 1862, one year into the American Civil War, and did not specifically include a provision allowing states to secede; the Preamble spoke of each state \"acting in its sovereign and independent character\" but also of the formation of a \"permanent federal government\". During the debates on drafting the Confederate Constitution, one proposal would have allowed states to secede from the Confederacy. The proposal was tabled with only the South Carolina delegates voting in favor of considering the motion.[266] The Confederate Constitution also explicitly denied States the power to bar slaveholders from other parts of the Confederacy from bringing their slaves into any state of the Confederacy or to interfere with the property rights of slave owners traveling between different parts of the Confederacy. In contrast with the secular language of the United States Constitution, the Confederate Constitution overtly asked God\\'s blessing (\"... invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God ...\").\\n', 'Some historians have referred to the Confederacy as a form of Herrenvolk democracy.[267][52]\\n', 'Executive', 'The Montgomery Convention to establish the Confederacy and its executive met on February 4, 1861. Each state as a sovereignty had one vote, with the same delegation size as it held in the U.S. Congress, and generally 41 to 50 members attended.[268] Offices were \"provisional\", limited to a term not to exceed one year. One name was placed in nomination for president, one for vice president. Both were elected unanimously, 6–0.[269]\\n', 'Jefferson Davis was elected provisional president. His U.S. Senate resignation speech greatly impressed with its clear rationale for secession and his pleading for a peaceful departure from the Union to independence. Although he had made it known that he wanted to be commander-in-chief of the Confederate armies, when elected, he assumed the office of Provisional President. Three candidates for provisional Vice President were under consideration the night before the February 9 election. All were from Georgia, and the various delegations meeting in different places determined two would not do, so Alexander H. Stephens was elected unanimously provisional Vice President, though with some privately held reservations.

Lincoln inherited an established government of long standing. The creation of the Confederacy was accomplished by men who saw themselves as fundamentally conservative. Although they referred to their \"Revolution\", it was in their eyes more a counter-revolution against changes away from their understanding of U.S. founding documents. In Davis\\' inauguration speech, he explained the Confederacy was not a French-like revolution, but a transfer of rule. The Montgomery Convention had assumed all the laws of the United States until superseded by the Confederate Congress.[271]\\n', 'The Permanent Constitution provided for a President of the Confederate States of America, elected to serve a six-year term but without the possibility of re-election. Unlike the United States Constitution, the Confederate Constitution gave the president the ability to subject a bill to a line item veto, a power also held by some state governors.\\n', 'The Confederate Congress could overturn either the general or the line item vetoes with the same two-thirds votes required in the U.S. Congress. In addition, appropriations not specifically requested by the executive branch required passage by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress.

The Provisional Confederate Congress was a unicameral assembly; each state received one vote.[272]\\n', 'The Permanent Confederate Congress was elected and began its first session February 18, 1862. The Permanent Congress for the Confederacy followed the United States forms with a bicameral legislature. The Senate had two per state, twenty-six Senators.

Two Congresses sat in six sessions until March 18, 1865.[272]\\n', \"The political influences of the civilian, soldier vote and appointed representatives reflected divisions of political geography of a diverse South. These in turn changed over time relative to Union occupation and disruption, the war impact on the local economy, and the course of the war.

Thus, the state courts generally continued to operate as they had done, simply recognizing the Confederate States as the national government.[276]\\n', 'Confederate district courts were authorized by Article III, Section 1, of the Confederate Constitution,[277] and President Davis appointed judges within the individual states of the Confederate States of America.[278] In many cases, the same US Federal District Judges were appointed as Confederate States District Judges. Confederate district courts began reopening in early 1861, handling many of the same type cases as had been done before. Prize cases, in which Union ships were captured by the Confederate Navy or raiders and sold through court proceedings, were heard until the blockade of southern ports made this impossible. After a Sequestration Act was passed by the Confederate Congress, the Confederate district courts heard many cases in which enemy aliens (typically Northern absentee landlords owning property in the South) had their property sequestered (seized) by Confederate Receivers.\\n', \"When the matter came before the Confederate court, the property owner could not appear because he was unable to travel across the front lines between Union and Confederate forces. Thus, the District Attorney won the case by default, the property was typically sold, and the money used to further the Southern war effort. Eventually, because there was no Confederate Supreme Court, sharp attorneys like South Carolina's Edward McCrady began filing appeals. This prevented their clients' property from being sold until a supreme court could be constituted to hear the appeal, which never occurred.[278] Where Federal troops gained control over parts of the Confederacy and re-established civilian government, US district courts sometimes resumed jurisdiction.[279]\\n\", 'Supreme Court – not established.\\n', 'District Courts – judges\\n', '\\n', 'Post Office', 'When the Confederacy was formed and its seceding states broke from the Union, it was at once confronted with the arduous task of providing its citizens with a mail delivery system, and, amid the American Civil War, the newly formed Confederacy created and established the Confederate Post Office. One of the first undertakings in establishing the Post Office was the appointment of John H. Reagan to the position of Postmaster General, by Jefferson Davis in 1861. This made him the first Postmaster General of the Confederate Post Office, and a member of Davis\\'s presidential cabinet. Writing in 1906, historian Walter Flavius McCaleb praised Reagan\\'s \"energy and intelligence... in a degree scarcely matched by any of his associates\".[280]\\n', \"When the war began, the US Post Office briefly delivered mail from the secessionist states. Mail that was postmarked after the date of a state's admission into the Confederacy through May 31, 1861, and bearing US postage was still delivered.[281] After this time, private express companies still managed to carry some of the mail across enemy lines. Later, mail that crossed lines had to be sent by 'Flag of Truce' and was allowed to pass at only two specific points. Mail sent from the Confederacy to the U.S. was received, opened and inspected at Fortress Monroe on the Virginia coast before being passed on into the U.S. mail stream. Mail sent from the North to the South passed at City Point, also in Virginia, where it was also inspected before being sent on.[282][283]\\n\", 'With the chaos of the war, a working postal system was more important than ever for the Confederacy. The Civil War had divided family members and friends and consequently letter writing increased dramatically across the entire divided nation, especially to and from the men who were away serving in an army. Mail delivery was also important for the Confederacy for a myriad of business and military reasons. Because of the Union blockade, basic supplies were always in demand and so getting mailed correspondence out of the country to suppliers was imperative to the successful operation of the Confederacy. Volumes of material have been written about the Blockade runners who evaded Union ships on blockade patrol, usually at night, and who moved cargo and mail in and out of the Confederate States throughout the course of the war. Of particular interest to students and historians of the American Civil War is Prisoner of War mail and Blockade mail as these items were often involved with a variety of military and other war time activities. The postal history of the Confederacy along with surviving Confederate mail has helped historians document the various people, places and events that were involved in the American Civil War as it unfolded.[284]\\n', 'Military', 'The Confederate States Army was the military land force of the Confederate States during the Civil War. On February 28, 1861, the Provisional Confederate Congress established a provisional volunteer army and gave control over military operations and authority for mustering state forces and volunteers to the newly chosen Confederate president, Jefferson Davis. On March 1, 1861, on behalf of the Confederate government, Davis assumed control of the military situation at Charleston, South Carolina, where South Carolina state militia besieged Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor, held by a small U.S. Army garrison. By March 1861, the Provisional Confederate Congress expanded the provisional forces and established a more permanent Confederate States Army.\\n', 'The total population of the Confederate Army is unknowable due to incomplete and destroyed Confederate records but estimates are between 750,000 and 1,000,000 troops. This does not include an unknown number of slaves pressed into army tasks, such as the construction of fortifications and defenses or driving wagons.[285] Confederate casualty figures also are incomplete and unreliable, estimated at 94,000 killed or mortally wounded, 164,000 deaths from disease, and between 26,000 and 31,000 deaths in Union prison camps. One incomplete estimate is 194,026.[citation needed]\\n', 'Civil liberties', 'The Confederacy actively used the army to arrest people suspected of loyalty to the United States. Historian Mark Neely found 4,108 names of men arrested and estimated a much larger total.[286] The Confederacy arrested pro-Union civilians in the South at about the same rate as the Union arrested pro-Confederate civilians in the North.[287] Neely argues:\\n', 'The Confederate citizen was not any freer than the Union citizen – and perhaps no less likely to be arrested by military authorities. In fact, the Confederate citizen may have been in some ways less free than his Northern counterpart. For example, freedom to travel within the Confederate states was severely limited by a domestic passport system.[288]', 'Economy', 'Slaves', 'Across the South, widespread rumors alarmed the whites by predicting the slaves were planning some sort of insurrection. Patrols were stepped up. The slaves did become increasingly independent, and resistant to punishment, but historians agree there were no insurrections. In the invaded areas, insubordination was more the norm than was loyalty to the old master; Bell Wiley says, \"It was not disloyalty, but the lure of freedom.\" Many slaves became spies for the North, and large numbers ran away to federal lines.[289]\\n', 'Lincoln\\'s Emancipation Proclamation, an executive order of the U.S. government on January 1, 1863, changed the legal status of three million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free\". The long-term effect was that the Confederacy could not preserve the institution of slavery and lost the use of the core element of its plantation labor force. Slaves were legally freed by the Proclamation, and became free by escaping to federal lines, or by advances of federal troops. Over 200,000 freed slaves were hired by the federal army as teamsters, cooks, launderers and laborers, and eventually as soldiers.[290][291] Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army.[292]\\n', 'Though the concept was promoted within certain circles of the Union hierarchy during and immediately following the war, no program of reparations for freed slaves was ever attempted. Unlike other Western countries, such as Britain and France, the U.S. government never paid compensation to Southern slave owners for their \"lost property\". The only place compensated emancipation was carried out was the District of Columbia.[293][294]\\n', 'Political economy', 'According to the 1860 United States census, about 31% of free households in the eleven states that would join the Confederacy owned slaves. Most whites were subsistence farmers who traded their surpluses locally.\\n', \"The plantations of the South, with white ownership and an enslaved labor force, produced substantial wealth from cash crops. It supplied two-thirds of the world's cotton, which was in high demand for textiles, along with tobacco, sugar, and naval stores (such as turpentine). These raw materials were exported to factories in Europe and the Northeast. Planters reinvested their profits in more slaves and fresh land, as cotton and tobacco depleted the soil. There was little manufacturing or mining; shipping was controlled by non-southerners.[295][296]\\n\", 'The plantations that enslaved over three million black people were the principal source of wealth. Most were concentrated in \"black belt\" plantation areas (because few white families in the poor regions owned slaves). For decades, there had been widespread fear of slave revolts. During the war, extra men were assigned to \"home guard\" patrol duty and governors sought to keep militia units at home for protection. Historian William Barney reports, \"no major slave revolts erupted during the Civil War.\" Nevertheless, slaves took the opportunity to enlarge their sphere of independence, and when union forces were nearby, many ran off to join them.[297][298]\\n', 'Slave labor was applied in industry in a limited way in the Upper South and in a few port cities. One reason for the regional lag in industrial development was top-heavy income distribution. Mass production requires mass markets, and slaves living in small cabins, using self-made tools and outfitted with one suit of work clothes each year of inferior fabric, did not generate consumer demand to sustain local manufactures of any description in the same way as did a mechanized family farm of free labor in the North. The Southern economy was \"pre-capitalist\" in that slaves were put to work in the largest revenue-producing enterprises, not free labor markets. That labor system as practiced in the American South encompassed paternalism, whether abusive or indulgent, and that meant labor management considerations apart from productivity.[299]\\n', 'Approximately 85% of both the North and South white populations lived on family farms, both regions were predominantly agricultural, and mid-century industry in both was mostly domestic. But the Southern economy was pre-capitalist in its overwhelming reliance on the agriculture of cash crops to produce wealth, while the great majority of farmers fed themselves and supplied a small local market. Southern cities and industries grew faster than ever before, but the thrust of the rest of the country\\'s exponential growth elsewhere was toward urban industrial development along transportation systems of canals and railroads. The South was following the dominant currents of the American economic mainstream, but at a \"great distance\" as it lagged in the all-weather modes of transportation that brought cheaper, speedier freight shipment and forged new, expanding inter-regional markets.[300]\\n', 'A third count of the pre-capitalist Southern economy relates to the cultural setting. White southerners did not adopt a work ethic, nor the habits of thrift that marked the rest of the country. It had access to the tools of capitalism, but it did not adopt its culture. The Southern Cause as a national economy in the Confederacy was grounded in \"slavery and race, planters and patricians, plain folk and folk culture, cotton and plantations\".[301]\\n', 'National production', 'The Confederacy started its existence as an agrarian economy with exports, to a world market, of cotton, and, to a lesser extent, tobacco and sugarcane. Local food production included grains, hogs, cattle, and gardens. The cash came from exports but the Southern people spontaneously stopped exports in early 1861 to hasten the impact of \"King Cotton\", a failed strategy to coerce international support for the Confederacy through its cotton exports. When the blockade was announced, commercial shipping practically ended (the ships could not get insurance), and only a trickle of supplies came via blockade runners. The cutoff of exports was an economic disaster for the South, rendering useless its most valuable properties, its plantations and their enslaved workers. Many planters kept growing cotton, which piled up everywhere, but most turned to food production. All across the region, the lack of repair and maintenance wasted away the physical assets.\\n', 'The eleven states had produced $155\\xa0million (~$4.29\\xa0billion in 2023) in manufactured goods in 1860, chiefly from local gristmills, and lumber, processed tobacco, cotton goods and naval stores such as turpentine. The main industrial areas were border cities such as Baltimore, Wheeling, Louisville and St. Louis, that were never under Confederate control. The government did set up munitions factories in the Deep South. Combined with captured munitions and those coming via blockade runners, the armies were kept minimally supplied with weapons. The soldiers suffered from reduced rations, lack of medicines, and the growing shortages of uniforms, shoes and boots. Shortages were much worse for civilians, and the prices of necessities steadily rose.[302]\\n', \"The Confederacy adopted a tariff or tax on imports of 15%, and imposed it on all imports from other countries, including the United States.[303] The tariff mattered little; the Union blockade minimized commercial traffic through the Confederacy's ports, and very few people paid taxes on goods smuggled from the North. The Confederate government in its entire history collected only $3.5\\xa0million in tariff revenue. The lack of adequate financial resources led the Confederacy to finance the war through printing money, which led to high inflation. The Confederacy underwent an economic revolution by centralization and standardization, but it was too little too late as its economy was systematically strangled by blockade and raids.[304]\\n\", 'Transportation systems', \"In peacetime, the South's extensive and connected systems of navigable rivers and coastal access allowed for cheap and easy transportation of agricultural products. The railroad system in the South had developed as a supplement to the navigable rivers to enhance the all-weather shipment of cash crops to market. Railroads tied plantation areas to the nearest river or seaport and so made supply more dependable, lowered costs and increased profits. In the event of invasion, the vast geography of the Confederacy made logistics difficult for the Union. Wherever Union armies invaded, they assigned many of their soldiers to garrison captured areas and to protect rail lines.\\n\", \"At the onset of the Civil War the South had a rail network disjointed and plagued by changes in track gauge as well as lack of interchange. Locomotives and freight cars had fixed axles and could not use tracks of different gauges (widths). Railroads of different gauges leading to the same city required all freight to be off-loaded onto wagons for transport to the connecting railroad station, where it had to await freight cars and a locomotive before proceeding. Centers requiring off-loading included Vicksburg, New Orleans, Montgomery, Wilmington and Richmond.[305] In addition, most rail lines led from coastal or river ports to inland cities, with few lateral railroads. Because of this design limitation, the relatively primitive railroads of the Confederacy were unable to overcome the Union naval blockade of the South's crucial intra-coastal and river routes.\\n\", \"The Confederacy had no plan to expand, protect or encourage its railroads. Southerners' refusal to export the cotton crop in 1861 left railroads bereft of their main source of income.[306] Many lines had to lay off employees; many critical skilled technicians and engineers were permanently lost to military service. In the early years of the war the Confederate government had a hands-off approach to the railroads. Only in mid-1863 did the Confederate government initiate a national policy, and it was confined solely to aiding the war effort.[307] Railroads came under the de facto control of the military. In contrast, the U.S. Congress had authorized military administration of Union-controlled railroad and telegraph systems in January 1862, imposed a standard gauge, and built railroads into the South using that gauge. Confederate armies successfully reoccupying territory could not be resupplied directly by rail as they advanced. The C.S. Congress formally authorized military administration of railroads in February 1865.\\n\", 'In the last year before the end of the war, the Confederate railroad system stood permanently on the verge of collapse. There was no new equipment and raids on both sides systematically destroyed key bridges, as well as locomotives and freight cars. Spare parts were cannibalized; feeder lines were torn up to get replacement rails for trunk lines, and rolling stock wore out through heavy use.[308]\\n', 'Horses and mules', 'The Confederate army experienced a persistent shortage of horses and mules and requisitioned them with dubious promissory notes given to local farmers and breeders. Union forces paid in real money and found ready sellers in the South. Both armies needed horses for cavalry and for artillery.[309] Mules pulled the wagons. The supply was undermined by an unprecedented epidemic of glanders, a fatal disease that baffled veterinarians.[310] After 1863 the invading Union forces had a policy of shooting all the local horses and mules that they did not need, in order to keep them out of Confederate hands. The Confederate armies and farmers experienced a growing shortage of horses and mules, which hurt the Southern economy and the war effort. The South lost half of its 2.5\\xa0million horses and mules; many farmers ended the war with none left. Army horses were used up by hard work, malnourishment, disease and battle wounds; they had a life expectancy of about seven months.[311]\\n', 'Financial instruments', 'Both the individual Confederate states and later the Confederate government printed Confederate States of America dollars as paper currency in various denominations, with a total face value of $1.5\\xa0billion. Much of it was signed by Treasurer Edward C. Elmore. Inflation became rampant as the paper money depreciated and eventually became worthless. The state governments and some localities printed their own paper money, adding to the runaway inflation.[312] Many bills still exist, although in recent years counterfeit copies have proliferated.\\n', 'The Confederate government initially wanted to finance its war mostly through tariffs on imports, export taxes, and voluntary donations of gold. After the spontaneous imposition of an embargo on cotton sales to Europe in 1861, these sources of revenue dried up and the Confederacy increasingly turned to issuing debt and printing money to pay for war expenses. The Confederate States politicians were worried about angering the general population with hard taxes. A tax increase might disillusion many Southerners, so the Confederacy resorted to printing more money. As a result, inflation increased and remained a problem for the southern states throughout the rest of the war.[313] By April 1863, for example, the cost of flour in Richmond had risen to $100 (~$2,475 in 2023) a barrel and housewives were rioting.[314]\\n', 'The Confederate government took over the three national mints in its territory: the Charlotte Mint in North Carolina, the Dahlonega Mint in Georgia, and the New Orleans Mint in Louisiana. During 1861 all of these facilities produced small amounts of gold coinage, and the latter half dollars as well. Since the mints used the current dies on hand, all appear to be U.S. issues. However, by comparing slight differences in the dies specialists can distinguish 1861-O half dollars that were minted either under the authority of the U.S. government, the State of Louisiana, or finally the Confederate States. Unlike the gold coins, this issue was produced in significant numbers (over 2.5\\xa0million) and is inexpensive in lower grades, although fakes have been made for sale to the public.[315] However, before the New Orleans Mint ceased operation in May 1861, the Confederate government used its own reverse design to strike four half dollars. This made one of the great rarities of American numismatics. A lack of silver and gold precluded further coinage. The Confederacy apparently also experimented with issuing one cent coins, although only 12 were produced by a jeweler in Philadelphia, who was afraid to send them to the South. Like the half dollars, copies were later made as souvenirs.[316]\\n', 'US coinage was hoarded and did not have any general circulation. U.S. coinage was admitted as legal tender up to $10, as were British sovereigns, French Napoleons and Spanish and Mexican doubloons at a fixed rate of exchange. Confederate money was paper and postage stamps.[317]\\n', 'Food shortages and riots', 'By mid-1861, the Union naval blockade virtually shut down the export of cotton and the import of manufactured goods. Food that formerly came overland was cut off.\\n', 'As women were the ones who remained at home, they had to make do with the lack of food and supplies. They cut back on purchases, used old materials, and planted more flax and peas to provide clothing and food. They used ersatz substitutes when possible, but there was no real coffee, only okra and chicory substitutes. The households were severely hurt by inflation in the cost of everyday items like flour, and the shortages of food, fodder for the animals, and medical supplies for the wounded.[318][319]\\n', 'State governments requested that planters grow less cotton and more food, but most refused. When cotton prices soared in Europe, expectations were that Europe would soon intervene to break the blockade and make them rich, but Europe remained neutral.[320] The Georgia legislature imposed cotton quotas, making it a crime to grow an excess. But food shortages only worsened, especially in the towns.[321]\\n', 'The overall decline in food supplies, made worse by the inadequate transportation system, led to serious shortages and high prices in urban areas. When bacon reached a dollar a pound in 1863, the poor women of Richmond, Atlanta and many other cities began to riot; they broke into shops and warehouses to seize food, as they were angry at ineffective state relief efforts, speculators, and merchants. As wives and widows of soldiers, they were hurt by the inadequate welfare system.[322][323][324]\\n', 'Devastation by 1865', 'By the end of the war deterioration of the Southern infrastructure was widespread. The number of civilian deaths is unknown. Every Confederate state was affected, but most of the war was fought in Virginia and Tennessee, while Texas and Florida saw the least military action. Much of the damage was caused by direct military action, but most was caused by lack of repairs and upkeep, and by deliberately using up resources. Historians have recently estimated how much of the devastation was caused by military action. Paul Paskoff calculates that Union military operations were conducted in 56% of 645 counties in nine Confederate states (excluding Texas and Florida). These counties contained 63% of the 1860 white population and 64% of the slaves. By the time the fighting took place, undoubtedly some people had fled to safer areas, so the exact population exposed to war is unknown.[325]\\n', \"The eleven Confederate States in the 1860 United States Census had 297 towns and cities with 835,000 people; of these 162 with 681,000 people were at one point occupied by Union forces. Eleven were destroyed or severely damaged by war action, including Atlanta (with an 1860 population of 9,600), Charleston, Columbia, and Richmond (with prewar populations of 40,500, 8,100, and 37,900, respectively); the eleven contained 115,900 people in the 1860 census, or 14% of the urban South. Historians have not estimated what their actual population was when Union forces arrived. The number of people (as of 1860) who lived in the destroyed towns represented just over 1% of the Confederacy's 1860 population. In addition, 45 court houses were burned (out of 830). The South's agriculture was not highly mechanized. The value of farm implements and machinery in the 1860 Census was $81\\xa0million; by 1870, there was 40% less, worth just $48\\xa0million. Many old tools had broken through heavy use; new tools were rarely available; even repairs were difficult.[326]\\n\", 'The economic losses affected everyone. Banks and insurance companies were mostly bankrupt. Confederate currency and bonds were worthless. The billions of dollars invested in slaves vanished. Most debts were also left behind. Most farms were intact, but most had lost their horses, mules and cattle; fences and barns were in disrepair. Paskoff shows the loss of farm infrastructure was about the same whether or not fighting took place nearby. The loss of infrastructure and productive capacity meant that rural widows throughout the region faced not only the absence of able-bodied men, but a depleted stock of material resources that they could manage and operate themselves. During four years of warfare, disruption, and blockades, the South used up about half its capital stock. The North, by contrast, absorbed its material losses so effortlessly that it appeared richer at the end of the war than at the beginning.[326]\\n', 'The rebuilding took years and was hindered by the low price of cotton after the war. Outside investment was essential, especially in railroads. One historian has summarized the collapse of the transportation infrastructure needed for economic recovery:[327]\\n', 'One of the greatest calamities which confronted Southerners was the havoc wrought on the transportation system. Roads were impassable or nonexistent, and bridges were destroyed or washed away. The important river traffic was at a standstill: levees were broken, channels were blocked, the few steamboats which had not been captured or destroyed were in a state of disrepair, wharves had decayed or were missing, and trained personnel were dead or dispersed. Horses, mules, oxen, carriages, wagons, and carts had nearly all fallen prey at one time or another to the contending armies. The railroads were paralyzed, with most of the companies bankrupt. These lines had been the special target of the enemy. On one stretch of 114 miles in Alabama, every bridge and trestle was destroyed, cross-ties rotten, buildings burned, water-tanks gone, ditches filled up, and tracks grown up in weeds and bushes\\xa0... Communication centers like Columbia and Atlanta were in ruins; shops and foundries were wrecked or in disrepair. Even those areas bypassed by battle had been pirated for equipment needed on the battlefront, and the wear and tear of wartime usage without adequate repairs or replacements reduced all to a state of disintegration.', 'Effect on women and families', 'More than 250,000 Confederate soldiers died during the war. Some widows abandoned their family farms and merged into the households of relatives, or even became refugees living in camps with high rates of disease and death.[328] In the Old South, being an \"old maid\" was an embarrassment to the woman and her family, but after the war, it became almost a norm.[329] Some women welcomed the freedom of not having to marry. Divorce, while never fully accepted, became more common. The concept of the \"New Woman\" emerged – she was self-sufficient and independent, and stood in sharp contrast to the \"Southern Belle\" of antebellum lore.[330]\\n', 'National flags', 'The first official flag of the Confederate States of America—called the \"Stars and Bars\"—originally had seven stars, representing the first seven states that initially formed the Confederacy. As more states joined, more stars were added, until the total was 13 (two stars were added for the divided states of Kentucky and Missouri). During the First Battle of Bull Run, (First Manassas) it sometimes proved difficult to distinguish the Stars and Bars from the Union flag.[citation needed] To rectify the situation, a separate \"Battle Flag\" was designed for use by troops in the field. Also known as the \"Southern Cross\", many variations sprang from the original square configuration.\\n', 'Although it was never officially adopted by the Confederate government, the popularity of the Southern Cross among both soldiers and the civilian population was a primary reason why it was made the main color feature when a new national flag was adopted in 1863.[334] This new standard—known as the \"Stainless Banner\"—consisted of a lengthened white field area with a Battle Flag canton. This flag too had its problems when used in military operations as, on a windless day, it could easily be mistaken for a flag of truce or surrender. Thus, in 1865, a modified version of the Stainless Banner was adopted. This final national flag of the Confederacy kept the Battle Flag canton, but shortened the white field and added a vertical red bar to the fly end.\\n', 'Because of its depiction in the 20th-century and popular media, many people consider the rectangular battle flag with the dark blue bars as being synonymous with \"the Confederate Flag\", but this flag was never adopted as a Confederate national flag.[334]\\n', 'The \"Confederate Flag\" has a color scheme similar to that of the most common Battle Flag design, but is rectangular, not square. The \"Confederate Flag\" is a highly recognizable symbol of the South in the United States today and continues to be a controversial icon.\\n', 'Southern Unionism', 'Unionism—opposition to the Confederacy—was strong in certain areas within the Confederate States. Southern Unionists were widespread in the mountain regions of Appalachia and the Ozarks.[335] Unionists, led by Parson Brownlow and Senator Andrew Johnson, took control of East Tennessee in 1863.[336] Unionists also attempted control over western Virginia, but never effectively held more than half of the counties that formed the new state of West Virginia.[337][338][339] Union forces captured parts of coastal North Carolina, and at first were largely welcomed by local unionists. The occupiers became perceived as oppressive, callous, radical and favorable to Freedmen. Occupiers pillaged, freed slaves, and evicted those who refused to swear loyalty oaths to the Union.[340]\\n', 'Claude Elliott estimates that only a third of the Texas population actively supported the Confederacy. Many Unionists supported the Confederacy after the war began, but many others clung to their Unionism throughout the war, especially in the northern counties, German districts in the Texas Hill Country, and majority Mexican areas.[341] Randolph B. Campbell states, \"In spite of terrible losses and hardships, most Texans continued throughout the war to support the Confederacy as they had supported secession\".[342] Dale Baum in his analysis of Texas politics in the era counters: \"This idea of a Confederate Texas united politically against northern adversaries was shaped more by nostalgic fantasies than by wartime realities.\" He characterizes Texas Civil War history as \"a morose story of intragovernmental rivalries coupled with wide-ranging disaffection that prevented effective implementation of state wartime policies\".[343]\\n', 'In Texas, local officials harassed and murdered Unionists and Germans during the Civil War. In Cooke County, Texas, 150 suspected Unionists were arrested; 25 were lynched without trial and 40 more were hanged after a summary trial. Draft resistance was widespread especially among Texans of German or Mexican descent, many of the latter leaving for Mexico. Confederate officials attempted to hunt down and kill potential draftees who had gone into hiding.[341] Over 4,000 suspected Unionists were imprisoned in the Confederate States without trial.[344]\\n', \"Up to 100,000 men living in states under Confederate control served in the Union Army or pro-Union guerilla groups. Although Southern Unionists came from all classes, most differed socially, culturally, and economically from the region's dominant pre-war planter class.[346]\\n\", 'Geography', 'Region and climate', 'The Confederate States of America claimed a total of 2,919 miles (4,698\\xa0km) of coastline, thus a large part of its territory lay on the seacoast with level and often sandy or marshy ground. Most of the interior portion consisted of arable farmland, though much was also hilly and mountainous, and the far western territories were deserts. The southern reaches of the Mississippi River bisected the country, and the western half was often referred to as the Trans-Mississippi. The highest point (excluding Arizona and New Mexico) was Guadalupe Peak in Texas at 8,750 feet (2,670\\xa0m).\\n', 'Much of the area claimed by the Confederate States of America had a humid subtropical climate with mild winters and long, hot, humid summers. The climate and terrain varied from vast swamps (such as those in Florida and Louisiana) to semi-arid steppes and arid deserts west of longitude 100 degrees west. The subtropical climate made winters mild but allowed infectious diseases to flourish. Consequently, on both sides more soldiers died from disease than were killed in combat,[347] a fact hardly atypical of pre-World War I conflicts.\\n', 'Demographics', 'Population', 'The United States Census of 1860[348] gives a picture of the overall 1860 population for the areas that had joined the Confederacy. The population numbers exclude non-assimilated Indian tribes.\\n', 'In 1860, the areas that later formed the eleven Confederate states (and including the future West Virginia) had 132,760 (2%) free blacks. Males made up 49% of the total population and females 51%.[353]\\n', 'Rural and urban population', 'The CSA was overwhelmingly rural. Few towns had populations of more than 1,000—the typical county seat had a population of fewer than 500. Of the twenty largest U.S. cities in the 1860 census, only New Orleans lay in Confederate territory.[354] Only 13 Confederate-controlled cities ranked among the top 100 U.S. cities in 1860, most of them ports whose economic activities vanished or suffered severely in the Union blockade. The population of Richmond swelled after it became the Confederate capital, reaching an estimated 128,000 in 1864.[355]\\n', 'The cities of the Confederacy included most prominently in order of size of population:\\n', 'Religion', 'The CSA was overwhelmingly Protestant.[356] Both free and enslaved populations identified with evangelical Protestantism. Baptists and Methodists together formed majorities of both the white and the slave population, becoming the Black church. Freedom of religion and separation of church and state were fully ensured by Confederate laws. Church attendance was very high and chaplains played a major role in the Army.[357]\\n', 'Most large denominations experienced a North–South split in the prewar era on the issue of slavery. The creation of a new country necessitated independent structures. For example, the Presbyterian Church in the United States split, with much of the new leadership provided by Joseph Ruggles Wilson.[358] Baptists and Methodists both broke off from their Northern coreligionists over the slavery issue, forming the Southern Baptist Convention and the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.[359][360] Elites in the southeast favored the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America, which had reluctantly split from the Episcopal Church in 1861.[361] Other elites were Presbyterians belonging to the 1861-founded Presbyterian Church in the United States. Catholics included an Irish working-class element in coastal cities and an old French element in southern Louisiana.[362][363]\\n', 'The southern churches met the shortage of Army chaplains by sending missionaries. One result was wave after wave of revivals in the Army.[364]\\n', 'Military leaders', 'Military leaders of the Confederacy (with their state or country of birth and highest rank)[365] included:\\n', 'See also', 'Notes', \"\\n^ Slaves are included in the above population according to the 1860 census.[7]\\n\\n^ Population values do not include Missouri, Kentucky, or the Arizona Territory.\\n\\n^ The cash crops circling the Seal are wheat, corn, tobacco, cotton, rice and sugar cane.

These beliefs could obviously not eliminate partisanship or prevent Confederates from holding on to and exploiting old political prejudices. Indeed, some states, notably Georgia and North Carolina, remained political tinderboxes throughout the war. Even the most bitter foes of the Confederate government, however, refused to form an opposition party, and the Georgia dissidents, to cite the most prominent example, avoided many traditional political activities.

But where there are parties, the opposition group is strongly impelled to formulate real alternative policies and to press for the adoption of these policies on a constructive basis. ... But the absence of a two-party system meant the absence of any available alternative leadership, and the protest votes which were cast in the 1863 Confederate mid-term election became more expressions of futile and frustrated dissatisfaction rather than implements of a decision to adopt new and different policies for the Confederacy.\"\\n\\n^ \"1860 Census Results\".

Antebellum southern society was defined in no small part by the shaping and working of large  tracts of land whose soil was tilled and staples tended by enslaved African-American laborers. This was, in short, a society dependent on what historians have variously referred to as the plantation system, the southern slave economy or, more commonly, the plantation economy... Slaveholders\\' demand for labor increased apace. The number of southern slaves jumped from under one million in 1790 to roughly four million by 1860.

By 1860, there were approximately 38,000 overseers working as plantation managers throughout the antebellum south. They were employed by the wealthiest of planters, planters who held multiple plantations and owned hundreds of enslaved Africans. By 1860, 85 percent of all cotton grown in the South was on plantations of 100 acres or more. On these plantations resided 91.2 percent of enslaved Africans. Planters came to own these Africans through the internal slave trade in the United States that moved to its cotton fields approximately one million enslaved laborers.\\n\\n^ Robert S.

Virginia was practically promised as a condition of secession by Vice President Stephens. It had rail connections south along the east coast and into the interior, and laterally west into Tennessee, parallel the U.S. border, a navigable river to the Hampton Roads to menace ocean approaches to Washington DC, trade via the Atlantic Ocean, an interior canal to North Carolina sounds. It was a great storehouse of supplies, food, feed, raw materials, and infrastructure of ports, drydocks, armories and the established Tredegar Iron Works. Nevertheless, Virginia never permanently ceded land for the capital district. A local homeowner donated his home to the City of Richmond for use as the Confederate White House, which was in turn rented to the Confederate government for the Jefferson Davis presidential home and administration offices.\\n\\n^ Martis, Historical Atlas, p. 2.\\n\\n^ Coulter, The Confederate States of America, p. 102.\\n\\n^ a b William Seward to Charles Francis Adams, April 10, 1861 in Marion Mills Miller, (ed.)

The Torpedo Bureau seeded defensive water-borne mines in principal harbors and rivers to compromise the Union naval superiority. These \"torpedoes\" were said to have caused more loss in U.S. naval ships and transports than by any other cause. Despite a rage for Congressional appropriations and public \"subscription ironclads\", armored platforms constructed in blockaded ports lacked the requisite marine engines to become ironclad warships.

The patchwork recruitment was (a) with and without state militia enrolment, (b) state Governor sponsorship and direct service under Davis, (c) for under six months, one year, three years and the duration of the war. Davis proposed recruitment for some period of years or the duration. Congress and the states equivocated.

About 90% of West Pointers in the U.S. Army resigned to join the Confederacy. Notably, of Virginia\\'s West Pointers, not 90% but 70% resigned for the Confederacy. Exemplary officers without military training included John B. Gordon, Nathan B. Forrest, James J. Pettigrew, John H. Morgan, Turner Ashby and John S. Mosby. Most preliminary officer training was had from Hardee\\'s \"Tactics\", and thereafter by observation and experience in battle. The Confederacy had no officers training camps or military academies, although early on, cadets of the Virginia Military Institute and other military schools drilled enlisted troops in battlefield evolutions.\\n\\n^ Coulter, The Confederate States of America, pp. 310–311. Early 1862 \"dried up the enthusiasm to volunteer\" due to the impact of victory\\'s battle casualties, the humiliation of defeats and the dislike of camp life with its monotony, confinement and mortal diseases. Immediately following the great victory at the Battle of Manassas, many believed the war was won and there was no need for more troops. Then the new year brought defeat over February 6–23: Fort Henry, Roanoke Island, Fort Donelson, Nashville—the first capital to fall. Among some not yet in uniform, the less victorious \"Cause\" seemed less glorious.\\n\\n^ Coulter, The Confederate States of America, p. 312. The government funded parades and newspaper ad campaigns, $2,000,000 for recruitment in Kentucky alone. With a state-enacted draft, Governor Brown with a quota of 12,000 raised 22,000 Georgia militia.\\n\\n^ Coulter, The Confederate States of America, pp. 313, 332. Officially dropping 425 officers by board review in October was followed immediately by 1,300 \"resignations\". Some officers who resigned then served honorably as enlisted for the duration or until they were made casualties, others resigned and returned home until conscription.\\n\\n^ Coulter, The Confederate States of America, p. 313\\n\\n^ Coulter, The Confederate States of America, pp. 313–314. Military officers including Joseph E. Johnston and Robert E. Lee, advocated conscription. In the circumstances they persuaded Congressmen and newspaper editors. Some editors advocating conscription in early 1862 later became \"savage critics of conscription and of Davis for his enforcement of it: Yancey of Alabama, Rhett of the Charleston \\'Mercury\\', Pollard of the Richmond \\'Examiner\\', and Senator Wigfall of Texas\".\\n\\n^ Coulter, The Confederate States of America, pp. 313–314, 319. Apart from their respective system exemptions, populations under Federal administration were subject to a \"wheel of fortune\" draft by aggregate number from each state in each draft, rather than the Confederate\\'s universal selection by age. Overrun areas such as Kentucky and Missouri were not subject to the draft, these areas expanded as the war progressed. The act abolishing the substitute system and nullifying the principal\\'s exemption was challenged in court as a violation of contract, but \"no court of importance so held\".\\n\\n^ Coulter, The Confederate States of America, pp. 315–317.\\n\\n^ Coulter, The Confederate States of America, p. 320. One such exemption was allowed for every 20 slaves on a plantation, the May 1863 reform required previous occupation and that the plantation of 20 slaves (or group of plantations within a five-mile area) had not been subdivided after the first exemption of April 1862.\\n\\n^ Coulter, The Confederate States of America, pp. 317–318. There were no organized political parties, but elective offices were also exempted. Virtually every position was contested with as many as twenty candidates for each office. Some scholars such as Martis interpret this as robust democratic society in wartime. Coulter attributes the widely new found enthusiasm for political careers as a means to \"get out of the army or keep from getting into it\". State Governor patronage expanded most notably in the tens of thousands in Georgia and North Carolina. In Greene County, Georgia, two dozen men ran for three offices; in protest, the women of the county ran a ticket of three men older than the 45 years conscription age.\\n\\n^ Coulter, The Confederate States of America, p. 319.\\n\\n^ Coulter, The Confederates States of America, p. 324.\\n\\n^ Coulter, The Confederate States of America, pp. 322–324, 326. The Conscription Bureau was run by Brigadier General Gabriel J. Rains until May 1863, Brigadier General Charles W. Field until July 1864, Colonel John S. Preston until \"the bitter end\". The \"odium and disgrace\" of conscription led many to volunteer. The Bureau was \"undoubtedly very inefficient\" as officers were culled from those unwanted for field service. Virginia had 26,000 volunteers to 9,000 conscripts. Governor Vance NC \"vigorously supported conscription\", uncharacteristically netting 21,343 conscripts to 8,000 volunteers. Necessary railroad positions once demeaned as \"blacks only\" were in 1864 taken by whites of military age.\\n\\n^ Coulter, The Confederate States of America, pp. 323–325, 327. Those governors with constitutional reservations refused to participate in conscription. In Fall 1864, Lee required of Davis a total number of 150,000 to match Grant\\'s numbers, \"else I fear a great calamity will befall us\". This led to Davis appointing officers such as General Pillow to recruiting positions. As a military recruiting officer, Gideon J. Pillow for whom Fort Pillow, was named, brought in 25,000 for Braxton Bragg and Joseph E. Johnston.\\n\\n^ Rable (1994) p. 265.\\n\\n^ Margaret Leech, Reveille in Washington (1942)\\n\\n^ Stephens, Alexander H. (1870). A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States (PDF).

In the Mississippi River Valley, during the first half of February, central Tennessee\\'s Fort Henry was lost and Fort Donelson fell with a small army.

Federal sea-based amphibious forces captured Roanoke Island, North Carolina along with a large garrison in February. In March, Confederates abandoned forts at Fernandia and St. Augustine Florida, and lost New Berne, North Carolina. In April, New Orleans fell and Savannah, Georgia was closed by the Battle of Fort Pulaski. In May retreating Confederates burned their two pre-war Navy yards at Norfolk and Pensacola.

In both events, as with the CSS Virginia, the Navy\\'s bravery and fighting skill was compromised in combat by mechanical failure in the engines or steering. The joint combined Army-Navy defense by General Robert E. Lee, and his successor and Commodore Josiah Tattnall III, repelled amphibious assault of Savannah for the duration of the war. Union General Tecumseh Sherman captured Savannah from the land side in December 1864. The British blockade runner Fingal was purchased and converted to the ironclad CSS Atlanta. It made two sorties, was captured by Union forces, repaired, and returned to service as the ironclad USS Atlanta supporting Grant\\'s Siege of Petersburg.\\n\\n^ Coulter, The Confederate States of America, p. 303. French shipyards built four corvettes, and two ironclad rams for the Confederacy, but the American minister prevented their delivery. British firms contracted to build two additional ironclad rams, but under threat from the U.S., the British government bought them for their own navy. Two of the converted blockade runners effectively raided up and down the Atlantic coast until the end of the war.\\n\\n^ Coulter, The Confederate States of America, pp. 354–356.

These beliefs could obviously not eliminate partisanship or prevent Confederates from holding on to and exploiting old political prejudices.\\xa0... Even the most bitter foes of the Confederate government, however, refused to form an opposition party, and the Georgia dissidents, to cite the most prominent example, avoided many traditional political activities. Only in North Carolina did there develop anything resembling a party system, and there the central values of the Confederacy\\'s two political cultures had a far more powerful influence on political debate than did organizational maneuvering.\"\\n\\n^ Donald, David Herbert, ed.

But where there are parties, the opposition group is strongly impelled to formulate real alternative policies and to press for the adoption of these policies on a constructive basis.\\xa0... But the absence of a two-party system meant the absence of any available alternative leadership, and the protest votes which were cast in the [1863 Confederate mid-term] election became more expressions of futile and frustrated dissatisfaction rather than implements of a decision to adopt new and different policies for the Confederacy.\"\\n\\n^ a b Coulter, The Confederate States of America, pp. 105–106\\n\\n^ Fred A.

Martin', '\\n', 'George Raymond Richard Martin[1] (born George Raymond Martin; September 20, 1948),[2] also known by his initials G.R.R.M.,[3] is an America author, television writer, and television producer. He is best known as the author of the series of epic fantasy novels A Song of Ice and Fire, which were adapted into the Primetime Emmy Award-winning television series Game of Thrones (2011–2019) and its prequel series House of the Dragon (2022–present). He also helped create the Wild Cards anthology series, and contributed worldbuilding for the video game Elden Ring (2022).\\n', 'In 2005, Lev Grossman of Time called Martin \"the American Tolkien\",[4][5][6] and in 2011, he was included on the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[7][8] He is a longtime resident of Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he helped fund Meow Wolf and owns the Jean Cocteau Cinema.[9][10][11] The city commemorates March 29 as George R.\\xa0R. Martin Day.[12][13]\\n', 'Early life[edit]', 'George Raymond Martin (he adopted the confirmation name Richard at 13 years old)[2] was born on September 20, 1948,[14] in Bayonne, New Jersey,[15] the son of longshoreman Raymond Collins Martin and Margaret Brady Martin. His mother\\'s family had once been wealthy, owning a successful construction business, but lost it all in the Great Depression, something Martin was reminded about every day when he passed what used to be his family\\'s dock and house.[16] He has two younger sisters, Darleen and Jane. He is predominantly of Irish descent;[17] a DNA test on the series Finding Your Roots showed him to be 53.6% \"British and Irish\", 22.4% Ashkenazi Jewish, and 15.6% \"Broadly Northwestern European\".[18][19]\\n', 'The family first lived in a house on Broadway belonging to Martin\\'s great-grandmother. In 1953, they moved to a federal housing project near the Bayonne docks.[20] During Martin\\'s childhood, his world consisted predominantly of \"First Street to Fifth Street\", between his grade school and his home. This limited world made him want to travel and experience other places, but the only way of doing so was through his imagination, and he became a voracious reader.[21]\\n', 'Martin began writing and selling monster stories for pennies to other neighborhood children, dramatic readings included. He had to stop once a customer\\'s mother complained about her child\\'s nightmares.[22] He also wrote stories about a mythical kingdom populated by his pet turtles — the turtles died frequently in their toy castle, so he decided they were killing each other off in \"sinister plots\".[23] Martin had a habit of starting \"endless stories\" that he never completed, as they did not turn out as well on paper as he had imagined them.[24]\\n', 'Martin attended Mary Jane Donohoe School and later Marist High School. While there, he became an avid comic-book fan, developing a strong interest in the superheroes being published by Marvel Comics,[25] and later credited Stan Lee for being one of his greatest literary influences; \"Maybe Stan Lee is the greatest literary influence on me, even more than Shakespeare or Tolkien.\"[26] A letter Martin wrote to the editor of Fantastic Four was printed in issue #20 (November 1963); it was the first of many sent, e.g., Fantastic Four #32, #34, and others. Fans who read his letters wrote him letters in turn, and through such contacts, Martin joined the fledgling comics fandom of the era, writing fiction for various fanzines;[27] he bought the first ticket to the world\\'s first Comic-Con, held in New York in 1964.[28][29] In 1965, Martin won comic fandom\\'s Alley Award for Best Fan Fiction for his prose superhero story \"Powerman vs. The Blue Barrier\".[30]\\n', \"In 1970, Martin earned a B.S. in journalism with a minor in history from Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism in Evanston, Illinois, graduating summa cum laude; he went on to complete his M.S. in Journalism in 1971, also from Medill.[31] Eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War, to which he objected, Martin applied for and obtained conscientious objector status;[32] he instead did alternative service work for two years (1972–1974) as a VISTA volunteer, attached to the Cook County Legal Assistance Foundation.[31]\\n\", 'Career[edit]', 'Early writing career[edit]', 'Martin began selling science fiction short stories professionally in 1970, at age 21. His first sale was \"The Hero\", sold to Galaxy magazine and published in its February 1971 issue; other sales soon followed. His first story to be nominated for the Hugo Award[33] and Nebula Awards was \"With Morning Comes Mistfall\", published in 1973 in Analog magazine. In 1975 his story \"...for a single yesterday\" about a post-apocalyptic timetripper was selected for inclusion in Epoch, a science fiction anthology edited by Roger Elwood and Robert Silverberg. His first novel, Dying of the Light, was completed in 1976 right before he moved to Dubuque and published in 1977. That same year the enormous success of Star Wars had a huge impact on the publishing industry and science fiction, and he sold the novel for the same amount he would make in three years of teaching.[34]\\n', \"The short stories he was able to sell in his early 20s gave him some profit but not enough to pay his bills, which prevented him from becoming the full-time writer he wanted to be. The need for a day job occurred simultaneously with the American chess craze which followed Bobby Fischer's victory in the 1972 world chess championship. Martin's own chess skills and experience allowed him to be hired as a tournament director for the Continental Chess Association, which ran chess tournaments on the weekends. This gave him a sufficient income, and because the tournaments only ran on Saturdays and Sundays, it allowed him to work as a writer five days a week from 1973 to 1976. By the time the chess craze subsided and no longer provided an income, he had become much better established as a writer.[35][36]\\n\", 'Teaching[edit]', 'In the mid-1970s, Martin met English professor George Guthridge from Dubuque, Iowa, at a science fiction convention in Milwaukee. Martin persuaded Guthridge (who later said that at that time he despised science fiction and fantasy) not only to give speculative fiction a second look, but also to write in the field himself. Guthridge has since been a finalist for the Hugo Award and twice for the Nebula Award for science fiction and fantasy. In 1998, Guthridge and Janet Berliner won the Bram Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in the Novel for their Children of the Dusk.[37]\\n', 'In turn, Guthridge helped Martin in finding a job at Clarke University (then Clarke College). Martin \"wasn\\'t making enough money to stay alive\" from writing and the chess tournaments, says Guthridge.[38] From 1976 to 1978, Martin was an English and journalism instructor at Clarke, and he became Writer In Residence at the college from 1978 to 1979.[39]\\n', 'Concentration on writing[edit]', 'While he enjoyed teaching, the sudden death of friend and fellow author Tom Reamy in late 1977 made Martin reevaluate his own life, and he eventually decided to try to become a full-time writer. In 1979 he resigned from his job and moved from Dubuque to Santa Fe, New Mexico at the end of the year.[40][41] There he would live alone for almost three years, a period he described as tremendously productive in regard of writing.[42]\\n', 'Martin is a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA); he served as the organization\\'s Southwest Regional Director from 1977 to 1979, and as its vice-president from 1996 to 1998.[43] In 1976, for Kansas City\\'s MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), Martin and his friend and fellow writer-editor Gardner Dozois conceived of and organized the first Hugo Losers\\' Party for the benefit of all past and present Hugo-losing writers on the evening following the convention\\'s Hugo Awards ceremony. Martin was nominated for two Hugos that year but lost both awards, for the novelette \"...and Seven Times Never Kill Man\" and the novella The Storms of Windhaven, co-written with Lisa Tuttle.[44] Although Martin often writes fantasy or horror, a number of his earlier works are science fiction tales occurring in a loosely defined future history, known informally as \"The Thousand Worlds\" or \"The Manrealm\".\\n', 'In 2017, Martin recalled that he had started writing science fiction-horror hybrids in the late 1970s to disprove a statement from a critic claiming that science fiction and horror were opposites and therefore incompatible. Martin considered Sandkings (1979) the best known of these. Another was the novella Nightflyers (1980), whose screen and television rights were purchased by Vista in 1984, which produced a 1987 film adaptation, Nightflyers, with a screenplay co-written by Martin.[45] Martin was unhappy about having to cut plot elements in order to accommodate the film\\'s small budget.[46] While not a hit at theatres, Martin believes that the film saved his career, and that everything he has written since exists in large part because of it.[47] He has also written at least one piece of political-military fiction, \"Night of the Vampyres\", collected in Harry Turtledove\\'s anthology The Best Military Science Fiction of the 20th Century (2001).[48]\\n', 'In 1982, Martin published a vampire novel titled Fevre Dream set in the 19th century on the Mississippi River. Unlike traditional vampire novels, in Fevre Dream vampires are not supernatural creatures, but are rather a different species related to humans created by evolution with superhuman powers. Critic Don D\\'Amassa has praised Fevre Dream for its strong 19th-century atmosphere and wrote: \"This is without question one of the greatest vampire novels of all time\".[49] Martin followed up Fevre Dream with another horror novel, The Armageddon Rag (1983). The unexpected commercial failure of The Armageddon Rag \"essentially destroyed my career as a novelist at the time\", he recalled, and made him consider going into real estate instead.[50]\\n', \"In 1984, the new editor of Baen Books, Betsy Mitchell, called Martin to ask him if he had considered doing a collection of Haviland Tuf adventures. Martin, who had several favorite series characters like Solomon Kane, Elric, Nicholas van Rijn and Magnus Ridolph, had made an attempt to create such a character on his own in the 1970s with his Tuf stories. He was interested, but was too occupied with the writing of his next book, the never-completed novel Black and White and Red All Over, which occupied most of his writing time the same year. But after the failure of The Armageddon Rag, all editors rejected his upcoming novel, and desperate for money, he accepted Mitchell's offer and wrote some more Tuf stories which were collected in Tuf Voyaging, which sold well enough for Mitchell to suggest a sequel. Martin was willing and agreed to do it, but before he got started he got an offer from Hollywood, where producer Philip DeGuere Jr. wanted to adapt The Armageddon Rag into a film. The film adaptation did not happen, but they stayed in touch, and when DeGuere became the producer for the revival of The Twilight Zone, Martin was offered a job as a writer. Working for television paid a lot better than writing literature, so he decided to move to Hollywood to seek a new career.[23][51][52] At first he worked as staff writer for the show, and then as an executive story consultant.\\n\", 'After the CBS series was cancelled, Martin migrated over to the already-underway satirical science fiction series Max Headroom. He worked on scripts and created the show\\'s \"Ped Xing\" character. However, before his scripts could go into production, the ABC show was cancelled in the middle of its second season. Martin was hired as a writer-producer on the new dramatic fantasy series Beauty and the Beast; in 1989, he became the show\\'s co-supervising producer and wrote 14 of its episodes.\\n', 'In 1987, Martin published a collection of short horror stories in Portraits of His Children. During this same period, Martin continued working in print media as a book-series editor, this time overseeing the development of the multi-author Wild Cards book series, which takes place in a shared universe in which a small slice of post–World War II humanity gains superpowers after the release of an alien-engineered virus; new titles are published in the ongoing series from Tor Books. In Second Person, Martin \"gives a personal account of the close-knit role-playing game (RPG) culture that gave rise to his Wild Cards shared-world anthologies\".[53] An important element in the creation of the multiple-author series was a campaign of Chaosium\\'s role-playing game Superworld (1983) that Martin ran in Albuquerque.[54] Admitting he became completely obsessed with the game, he stopped writing literature for most of 1983, which he refers to as his \"lost year\", but his shrinking bank accounts made him realize he had to come up with something, and got the idea that perhaps the stories and characters created in Superworld could somehow become profitable.[55] Martin\\'s own contributions to Wild Cards have included Thomas Tudbury, \"The Great and Powerful Turtle\", a powerful psychokinetic whose flying \"shell\" consisted of an armored VW Beetle. As of June\\xa02011[update], 21 Wild Cards volumes had been published in the series; earlier that same year, Martin signed the contract for the 22nd volume, Low Ball (2014), published by Tor Books. In early 2012, Martin signed another Tor contract for the 23rd Wild Cards volume, High Stakes, which was released in August 2016.[56]\\n', 'In August 2016, Martin announced that Universal Cable Productions had acquired the rights to adapt the Wild Cards novels into a television series.[57] He noted that he himself would not write for the adaptation due to focusing on A Song of Ice and Fire.[57]\\n', 'A Song of Ice and Fire[edit]', 'In 1991, Martin briefly returned to writing novels. He had grown frustrated that his TV pilots and screenplays were not getting made[58] and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes.[59] This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising his imagination.[58] Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.[60]\\n', 'His epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire, was inspired by the Wars of the Roses, The Accursed Kings[61] and Ivanhoe. Though Martin originally conceptualized it as being three volumes,[62] it is currently slated to comprise seven. The first, A Game of Thrones, was published in 1996, followed by A Clash of Kings in 1998 and A Storm of Swords in 2000. In November 2005, A Feast for Crows, the fourth novel in this series, became The New York Times No. 1 Bestseller.[63] The fifth book, A Dance with Dragons, was published July 12, 2011, and became an international bestseller, including achieving a No. 1 spot on the New York Times Bestseller List[64] and many others; it remained on the New York Times list for 88 weeks.\\n', \"In 2012, A Dance With Dragons made the final ballot for science fiction and fantasy's Hugo Award,[65] World Fantasy Award,[66] Locus Poll Award, and the British Fantasy Award;[67] the novel went on to win the Locus Poll Award for Best Fantasy Novel.[68] Two more novels are planned in the series: The Winds of Winter and the final volume A Dream of Spring.\\n\", 'On April 25, 2018, Martin announced the release date of his new book, Fire & Blood, dealing with the history of House Targaryen, which was released on November 20, 2018.[69] Should Martin die before finishing the A Song of Ice and Fire series, former collaborators have said that they will not conclude the series for him.[70]\\n', 'HBO adaptation of  A Song of Ice and Fire[edit]', 'HBO Productions purchased the television rights for the A Song of Ice and Fire series in 2007. Although busy completing A Dance With Dragons and other projects, George R. R. Martin was heavily involved in the production of the television series adaptation of his books. Martin\\'s involvement included the selection of a production team and participation in scriptwriting; the opening credits list him as a co-executive producer of the series. The original pilot was shot between October 24 and November 19, 2009, on location in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Morocco.[71] It was received so poorly by HBO executives that they did not make a decision for four months after the pilot was delivered.[72] In March 2010, HBO\\'s decision to greenlight the series was announced,[73] with the production of the series scheduled to start June 2010.[74] HBO however demanded the first episode be reshot, and wanted all the scenes from Morocco scrapped.[75] The first episode (\"Winter Is Coming\") premiered on HBO in the United States and Canada on April 17, 2011. It was seen initially by 2.2 million viewers. The first season was nominated for 13 Emmy Awards, ultimately winning two: one for its opening title credits, and one for Peter Dinklage as Best Supporting Actor.[76]\\n', 'HBO ordered a second season of Game of Thrones on April 19, 2011, two days after the series premiere.[77] The second season obtained a 15% increase in budget in order to be able to stage the war\\'s most important battle,[78] the Battle of the Blackwater, in episode nine which was written by George R. R. Martin. Filming took place during 106 shooting days. During three-quarters of those, two crews (\"Dragon\" and \"Wolf\") were working simultaneously in different locations.[79] Alan Taylor was promoted to co-executive producer and directed four episodes, including the season premiere and finale. David Petrarca and David Nutter each directed two episodes, while series cinematographer Alik Sakharov and filmmaker Neil Marshall directed the remaining two. The second season premiered in the United States on HBO on April 1, 2012, and concluded on June 3, 2012. U.S. viewership rose by approximately 8% over the course of the season, from 3.9 million to 4.2 million by the season finale. The second season won six of the twelve Emmy Awards for which it was nominated.[76]\\n', \"Game of Thrones rapidly became a critical and commercial success after the second season. HBO renewed the series for a third season on April 10, 2012, nine days after the second season's premiere. Production began in July 2012 [80] and concluded with the wrap of the unit filming in Iceland on November 24, 2012. The third season is based on the first half of the novel A Storm of Swords. Benioff had previously said that A Storm of Swords would need to be adapted in two seasons on account of its length. Benioff and Weiss also noted that they thought of Game of Thrones as an adaptation of the series as a whole, rather than of individual novels, which gave them the liberty to move scenes back and forth across novels according to the requirements of the screen adaptation.[81] Season 3 saw the first significant use of the Valyrian languages, spoken in doomed Valyria and its former colonies in Essos. The constructed languages were developed by linguist David J. Peterson based on the few words Martin invented for the novels. Peterson had previously developed the Dothraki language, used principally in season 1.[82] The third season premiered on HBO on March 31, 2013, and concluded on June 9, 2013. The third season was seen by 14.2 million viewers.[83]  It won 2 of the 16 Emmy Awards for which it was nominated.[76]\\n\", 'Two days after third season premiere, HBO ordered the fourth season on April 2, 2013, which began filming in July 2013.[84] The season is adapted primarily from the second half of A Storm of Swords, along with elements of A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons. Showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss co-wrote seven out of ten episodes. The remaining three episodes were written by Bryan Cogman (two episodes), and George R. R. Martin (one episode). For this season, the filming lasted 136 days and was completed on November 21, 2013.[85] The fourth season premiered in the United States on HBO on April 6, 2014, and concluded on June 15, 2014. The season was met with largely positive reviews. It won 4 of the 19 Emmy Awards for which it was nominated.[76] With its fourth season, Game of Thrones has become the most-watched HBO series in history (surpassing the fourth season of The Sopranos which had a gross audience of 18.2 million viewers), averaging 18.4 million viewers across multiple platforms, including live viewing, encores, DVR views, HBO GO and On Demand views.[86]\\n', 'Up until the fourth season, Martin wrote one episode for each season. In 2022, Martin said that he had been estranged from the show during the production process of the last 4 seasons (starting with season 5).[87] In the early seasons, Martin wrote and read scripts, consulted on casting decisions and visited sets. Over time, however, he stepped back to focus on his long-delayed next \"Thrones\" novel, The Winds of Winter.[87] Following the gargantuan success of the fourth season, HBO ordered the fifth season on April 8, 2014, together with the sixth season, which began filming in July 2014. The season primarily adapts the storylines from A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons, also with original content not found in Martin\\'s novels. This season set a Guinness World Record for winning the highest number of Emmy Awards for a series in a single season and year, winning 12 out of 24 nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series.[88]\\n', 'With a budget over $100 million for the whole season, filming for the sixth season began in July 2015 and ended on December. The season filmed in five different countries: Northern Ireland, Spain, Croatia, Iceland, and Canada. This season saw the overall plot of the show diverging from the source material. Some of the season\\'s storyline is derived from content not yet published in Martin\\'s A Song of Ice and Fire series, although a significant amount of material from A Feast for Crows, A Dance with Dragons and the upcoming sixth novel The Winds of Winter, which Martin previously outlined to showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, was used.[89] The season was largely met with positive reviews.[90] The \"Battle of the Bastards\" episode received immense critical acclaim, with many calling it one of the best television episodes of all time.[91] U.S. viewership rose compared to the previous season, and by approximately 13 percent over its course, from 7.9 million to 8.9 million by the finale. The season won 12 of the 23 Emmy Awards for which it was nominated.[76]\\n', 'Three days before the premiere of the episode \"The Red Woman\", HBO ordered the seventh season. Due to necessary weather conditions required for filming, the production of the penultimate season of the show was delayed that year.[92] Filming began only on August 31, 2016, at Titanic Studios in Belfast,[93] and ended in February 2017.[94] Unlike previous seasons, the seventh and eighth seasons largely consisted of original content not found in the source material. This season comprised only seven episodes. The showrunners stated that they were unable to produce 10 episodes in the show\\'s usual 12 to 14 month time frame, as Weiss said \"It\\'s crossing out of a television schedule into more of a mid-range movie schedule\".[95] The average runtime of an episode in this season was approximately 63 minutes. The series received 22 nominations for the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards and won 9 of them, including \"Outstanding Drama Series\".[96]\\n', 'Unlike its prior seasons, the final one took a year gap for its production and filming. The eighth season consisted of only six episodes, though the average runtime of an episode was 68 minutes, the longest of all seasons, with \"The Long Night\" consisting of 81 minutes. The season was met with mixed reviews from critics. While the performances, production values and music score were praised, criticism was mainly directed at the shorter runtime of the season as well as numerous creative decisions made by the showrunners. Many commentators deemed it to be a disappointing conclusion to the series. The season received 32 nominations at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards, the most for a single season of television in history. It won twelve, including Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for Peter Dinklage.[97]\\n', 'Three years after the show ended, a prequel series, House of the Dragon, premiered on HBO in August 21, 2022.  Based on parts of the novel Fire & Blood, the series is set about 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones. Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Five days after its premiere, the series was renewed for a second season by HBO. On September 1, Sapochnik departed as showrunner,[98] with another veteran Game of Thrones director Alan Taylor replacing him as the co-showrunner for the upcoming second season.[99]\\n', 'In June 2022, it was reported that a Jon Snow sequel series with Kit Harington to reprise his role was in early development at HBO.[100] The working title is Snow and Martin confirmed his involvement with the project and that Harington initiated the idea.[101] Also in June, Martin said there were still three other live-action series in development: 10,000 Ships (written by Amanda Segal), 9 Voyages aka Sea Snake (written by Bruno Heller), and the Dunk & Egg prequel series (written by Steven Conrad), tentatively titled either The Hedge Knight or Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.[101]\\n', 'In January 2021, an animated drama series was announced as in development at HBO Max.[102] In July 2021, two more animated series were in development at HBO Max, with one being set in Yi Ti, a nation in Essos loosely based on Imperial China.[103]\\n', 'Themes[edit]', 'Martin\\'s work has been described as having \"complex story lines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing\" by literary critic Jeff VanderMeer.[104] Dana Jennings of the New York Times described Martin\\'s work as \"fantasy for grown ups\"[105] and Lev Grossman wrote that it was dark and cynical.[106] Martin\\'s first novel, Dying of the Light, set the tone for some of his future work; it unfolds on a mostly abandoned planet that is slowly becoming uninhabitable as it moves away from its sun. This story has a strong sense of melancholy. His characters are often unhappy or, at least, unsatisfied, in many cases holding on to idealisms in spite of an otherwise chaotic and ruthless world, and often troubled by their own self-seeking or violent actions, even as they undertake them. Many have elements of tragic heroes or antiheroes in them; reviewer T. M. Wagner writes: \"Let it never be said Martin doesn\\'t share Shakespeare\\'s fondness for the senselessly tragic.\"[107]\\n', '\\nThe overall gloominess of A Song of Ice and Fire can be an obstacle for some readers; the Inchoatus Group writes that, \"If this absence of joy is going to trouble you, or you\\'re looking for something more affirming, then you should probably seek elsewhere.\"[108] However, for many fans, it is precisely this level of \"realness\" and \"completeness\"–including many characters\\' imperfections, moral and ethical ambiguity, and (often sudden) consequential plot twists that is endearing about Martin\\'s work. Many find that this is what makes the series\\' story arcs compelling enough to keep following despite its sheer brutality and intricately messy and interwoven plotlines; as TM Wagner points out:', \"There's great tragedy here, but there's also excitement, humor, heroism even in weaklings, nobility even in villains, and, now and then, a taste of justice after all. It's a rare gift when a writer can invest his story with that much humanity.[107]\", 'Martin\\'s characters are multifaceted, each with intricate pasts, aspirations, and ambitions. Publishers Weekly writes of his ongoing epic fantasy A Song of Ice and Fire: \"The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates.\"[109] Misfortune, injury, and death (including false death and reanimation) often befall major or minor characters, no matter how attached the reader has become. Martin has described his penchant for killing off important characters as being necessary for the story\\'s depth: \"when my characters are in danger, I want you to be afraid to turn the page, (so) you need to show right from the beginning that you\\'re playing for keeps\".[110]\\n', 'In distinguishing his work from others, Martin makes a point of emphasizing realism and plausible social dynamics above an over-reliance on magic and a simplistic \"good versus evil\" dichotomy, for which contemporary fantasy writing is often criticized. Notably, Martin\\'s work makes a sharp departure from the prevalent \"heroic knights and chivalry\" schema that has become a mainstay in fantasy as derived from J. R. R. Tolkien\\'s The Lord of the Rings. He specifically critiques the oversimplification of Tolkien\\'s themes and devices by imitators in ways that he has humorously described as \"Disneyland Middle Ages\",[111] which gloss over or ignore major differences between medieval and modern societies, particularly social structures, ways of living, and political arrangements. Martin has been described as \"the American Tolkien\" by literary critics.[112] While Martin finds inspiration in Tolkien\\'s legacy,[113] he aims to go beyond what he sees as Tolkien\\'s \"medieval philosophy\" of \"if the king was a good man, the land would prosper\" to delve into the complexities, ambiguities, and vagaries of real-life power: \"We look at real history and it\\'s not that simple... Just having good intentions doesn\\'t make you a wise king.\"[114] Per this fact Martin has been credited with the rise of grimdark fantasy, a modern form of an \"anti-Tolkien\" approach to fantasy writing which,[115] according to British science fiction and fantasy novelist Adam Roberts, is characterized by its reaction to Tolkien\\'s idealism even though it owes a lot to Tolkien\\'s work.[116][117] The Canadian fantasy writer R. Scott Bakker \"says he wouldn\\'t have been able to publish his fantasy novels without the success George R. R. Martin achieved first\".[118] Similarly, Mark Lawrence, author of Prince of Thorns, was inspired by Martin and impressed by his Red Wedding scene.[119]\\n', 'The author makes a point of grounding his work on a foundation of historical fiction, which he channels to evoke important social and political elements of primarily the European medieval era that differ markedly from elements of modern times, including the multigenerational, rigid, and often brutally consequential nature of the hierarchical class system of feudal societies[120] that is in many cases overlooked in fantasy writing. Even as A Song of Ice and Fire is a fantasy series that employs magic and the surreal as central to the genre, Martin is keen to ensure that magic is merely one element of many that moves his work forward,[121] not a generic deus ex machina that is itself the focus of his stories, which is something he has been very conscious about since reading Tolkien; \"If you look at The Lord of the Rings, what strikes you, it certainly struck me, is that although the world is infused with this great sense of magic, there is very little onstage magic. So you have a sense of magic, but it\\'s kept under very tight control, and I really took that to heart when I was starting my own series.\"[122] Martin\\'s ultimate aim is an exploration of the internal conflicts that define the human condition, which, in deriving inspiration from William Faulkner,[123] he ultimately describes as the only reason to read any literature, regardless of genre.[124]\\n', 'In 2018, Martin called The Lord of the Rings, The Great Gatsby, Gone with the Wind, Great Expectations, Lonesome Dove, Catch-22, and Charlotte\\'s Web \"favorites all, towering masterpieces, books that changed my life\".[125]\\n', 'Producing[edit]', \"In 2017, Martin confirmed he would serve as an executive producer of the HBO television series adaptation of the 2010 science fantasy novel Who Fears Death by Nnedi Okorafor.[126] Martin also contributed to the 2022 video game titled Elden Ring, writing the worldbuilding aspects for it.[127][128] In February 2021, it was reported that Martin and Kalinda Vazquez were developing a TV adaptation of Roadmarks by Roger Zelazny, which Martin pitched to HBO in 2020. Martin will be an executive producer, Vazquez the showrunner, writer and executive producer.[129] In March 2021, he signed an overall deal with HBO.[130] Martin will serve as an executive producer of the Peacock TV adaptation in development of his Wild Cards book series, together with Melinda M. Snodgrass and Vince Gerardis, Martin's manager.[131] He will serve as an executive producer of the 2022 AMC series Dark Winds based on Tony Hillerman's Leaphorn & Chee books, together with the creator Graham Roland, the showrunner Vince Calandra, the lead Zahn McClarnon, Kiowa Gordon, Chris Eyre, Robert Redford, Tina Elmo and Vince Gerardis.[132] In 2021, Martin served as one of the producers of the short film Night of the Cooters based on the eponymous short story by Howard Waldrop.[133][134]\\n\", 'Relationship with fans[edit]', 'Martin actively contributes to his blog, Not a Blog; in April 2018, he moved his blog from Livejournal to his own website.[135]\\n', 'Martin\\'s official fan club is the \"Brotherhood Without Banners\", which has a regular posting board at the Forum of the website westeros.org, which is focused on his A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy series. At the annual World Science Fiction Convention every year, the Brotherhood Without Banners hosts a large, on-going hospitality suite that is open to all members of the Worldcon.[136]\\n', 'Martin is opposed to fan fiction, which he views as copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers in terms of developing skills in worldbuilding and character development.[137][138]\\n', 'Conventions[edit]', 'Martin is known for his regular attendance at science fiction conventions and comics conventions, and his accessibility to fans. In the early 1980s, critic and writer Thomas Disch identified Martin as a member of the \"Labor Day Group\", writers who regularly congregated at the annual Worldcon, usually held on or around the Labor Day weekend. Since the early 1970s, he has also attended regional science fiction conventions; further, since 1986, Martin has participated annually in Albuquerque\\'s smaller regional convention Bubonicon, near his New Mexico home.[139][140] He was the Guest of Honor at the 61st World Science Fiction Convention in Toronto, held in 2003.[141][142]\\n', 'In December 2016, Martin was a key speaker at the Guadalajara International Book Fair 2016 in Mexico where the author provided hints about the next two books in the series A Song of Ice and Fire.[143]\\n', 'In 2020, Martin fulfilled his duties as “toastmaster” of the Hugo Awards. During the event, he mispronounced several names, including that of R. F. Kuang, which she considered a microaggression. Martin later apologized for mispronouncing the names.[144][145]\\n', 'Criticism[edit]', 'Martin has been criticized by some of his readers for the long periods between books in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, notably the six-year gap between the fourth volume, A Feast for Crows (2005), and the fifth volume, A Dance with Dragons (2011).[146][147] In 2010, Martin had responded to fan criticisms by saying he was unwilling to write only his A Song of Ice and Fire series, noting that working on other prose and compiling and editing different book projects have always been part of his working process.[148]\\n', 'Personal life[edit]', 'In the early 1970s, Martin was in a relationship with fellow science fiction/fantasy author Lisa Tuttle, with whom he co-wrote Windhaven.[149]\\n', 'While attending an East Coast science fiction convention he met his first wife, Gale Burnick; they were married in 1975 and moved from their Chicago apartment and into a house in Dubuque in 1976. Both of them grew tired of the hard winters there, and when she graduated from Clarke in June 1979, he resigned from his job and they decided to move to New Mexico. The year before they had \"fallen in love\" with Santa Fe on their way to the worldcon in Phoenix. His wife went down and bought a house while Martin stayed behind to sell their home and finish the semester. The marriage ended in divorce in 1979,[150] before they could be reunited in Santa Fe. Instead he settled there alone from December that same year until September 1981, when what would be his longtime partner Parris McBride moved in with him.[151][152][42] On February 15, 2011, Martin married McBride during a small ceremony at their Santa Fe home. On August 19, 2011, they held a larger wedding ceremony and reception at Renovation, the 69th World Science Fiction Convention.[153] They have no children.\\n', \"He and McBride are supporters of the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary in New Mexico.[154] In early 2013, he purchased Santa Fe's Jean Cocteau Cinema and Coffee House, which had been closed since 2006. He had the property completely restored, including both its original 35mm capability to which was added digital projection and sound; the Cocteau officially reopened for business on August 9, 2013.[155] In 2019, he opened a bookstore named Beastly Books, after Beauty and the Beast, next to Jean Cocteau.[156] Martin has also supported Meow Wolf, an arts collective in Santa Fe, having pledged $2.7\\xa0million toward a new art space in January 2015.[157][158]\\n\", 'In response to a question on his religious views, Martin replied: \"I suppose I\\'m a lapsed Catholic. You would consider me an atheist or agnostic. I find religion and spirituality fascinating. I would like to believe this isn\\'t the end and there\\'s something more, but I can\\'t convince the rational part of me that makes any sense whatsoever.\"[159]\\n', \"Martin is a fan of the New York Jets, the New York Giants and the New York Mets.[160][161][162] He is also a fan of the Grateful Dead, and says that the band's music may have influenced his work.[163]\\n\", 'Martin made a guest appearance as himself in an episode, \"El Skeletorito\", of the Adult Swim show Robot Chicken.[164] He also appeared in SyFy\\'s Z Nation as a zombie version of himself in season two\\'s \"The Collector\", where he is still signing copies of his new novel.[165][166] In Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!, he is killed when watching a movie at the theatre.[167]\\n', 'Philanthropy[edit]', 'In 2014, Martin launched a campaign on Prizeo to raise funds for Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary and the Food Depot of Santa Fe. As part of the campaign, Martin offered one donor the chance to accompany him on a trip to the wolf sanctuary, including a helicopter ride and dinner. Martin also offered those donating $20,000 or more the opportunity to have a character named after them and \"killed off\" in an upcoming A Song of Ice and Fire novel. The campaign garnered media attention and raised a total of $502,549.[168][169]\\n', 'In 2017, Martin announced that he was funding The Miskatonic Scholarship. The Miskatonic Scholarship allows a writer of Lovecraftian cosmic horror to attend the Odyssey Writing Workshop, a six-week writing workshop held at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire.[170][171]\\n', 'Politics[edit]', 'Growing up, Martin avoided the draft to the Vietnam War by being a conscientious objector and did two years of alternative service. He generally opposes war and thought the Vietnam War was a \"terrible mistake for America\".[172]\\n', 'While he did not endorse Barack Obama in 2008, Martin endorsed him for re-election in 2012 calling Obama the most intelligent president since Jimmy Carter.[173] In 2014, Martin endorsed Democratic Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico.[174]\\n', 'In the midst of pressure to pull the 2014 feature film The Interview from theaters, the Jean Cocteau Cinema in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which has been owned by Martin since 2013, decided to show the film. Theater manager Jon Bowman told the Santa Fe New Mexican, \"Martin feels strongly about the First Amendment and the idea of artists having the ability to speak their minds and not having to worry about being targets.\"[175]\\n', 'Immediately following Bernie Sanders\\' defeat in the U.S. Democratic primary elections, he supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general 2016 United States presidential election, and criticized Donald Trump during the election and following her defeat, commenting that Trump would \"become the worst president in American history\".[176][177][178] In response to fans of Martin who compared Trump favorably to characters from A Song of Ice and Fire, Martin doubled-down on his criticism of Trump by making the case to his fans that Trump shares many personality traits in common with King Joffrey, a near-universally hated character from the series, concluding that \"Trump is a Grown-Up Joffrey.\"[179][180]\\n', 'In May 2019, Martin endorsed

      "['From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia', 'Contents', 'Atlanta (TV series)', '\\n', 'Atlanta is an American comedy-drama television series created by Donald Glover. The series follows college dropout and music manager Earnest \"Earn\" Marks (Glover) and rapper Alfred \"Paper Boi\" Miles (Brian Tyree Henry) as they navigate a strange, seemingly otherworldly Atlanta hip hop scene. Atlanta also stars LaKeith Stanfield as Darius, Earn and Alfred\\'s eccentric friend, and Zazie Beetz as Vanessa \"Van\" Kiefer, Earn\\'s on-again-off-again girlfriend and the mother of his daughter.\\n', 'The series was produced by RBA, 343 Incorporated, MGMT. Entertainment, and FXP and is primarily set and filmed in Atlanta and the surrounding Georgia area; the third season features international filming locations. Atlanta is one of the only American cable television series to feature an all-Black writing staff (featuring Glover as writer, executive producer and showrunner),[6][7] with much of the focus set on examining race, class, identity, the American Dream, existentialism and modern African-American culture through an Afro-Surrealist lens.[8] It is also notable for its use of bottle and standalone episodes, which often do not feature the main cast.\\n', 'Atlanta premiered on September 6, 2016,[9] and was initially exclusively broadcast on cable channel FX in the United States and in other countries through the Fox Networks Group, and was distributed in the United States by Disney–ABC Domestic Television. The fourth and final season concluded on November 10, 2022,[10][11] with the series containing 41 episodes overall.\\n', 'Atlanta is widely regarded as one of the best television series of the 2010s.[12][13][14][15] It has received numerous awards and nominations, including two Golden Globe Awards for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy; Glover has received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy, and two Primetime Emmy Awards, one for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and one Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, the latter being the first ever awarded to an African American.\\n', 'Plot[edit]', 'The series follows Earn (Donald Glover) during his daily life in Atlanta, Georgia, as he tries to redeem himself in the eyes of his ex-girlfriend Van (Zazie Beetz), who is also the mother of his daughter Lottie, as well as his parents and his cousin Alfred (Brian Tyree Henry), who raps under the stage name \"Paper Boi\". Having dropped out of Princeton University, Earn has no money and no home and consequently alternates between staying with his parents and his ex-girlfriend. Once he realizes that his cousin is on the verge of stardom, he seeks to reconnect with him in order to improve his life and the life of his daughter.\\n', \"Although there is an overarching story depicting Earn and Paper Boi's struggles as the latter ascends through the hip hop scene, the series has been noted for its lack of emphasis on multi-episode story arcs, instead using a somewhat surrealistic style of episodic storytelling that Glover has likened to short stories, as have some critics.[16][17][18]\\n\", 'Cast and characters[edit]', 'Main[edit]', 'Recurring[edit]', 'The series also features guest appearances by celebrities who portray fictionalized versions of themselves. Offset, Quavo and Takeoff portray Alfred\\'s drug suppliers. Gunna and Jai Paul appear as a guest at Alfred\\'s studio session and a London partygoer, respectively. Lloyd and Jaleel White feature as participants in a charity basketball game. Jane Adams plays an entertainment agent, Michael Vick portrays a quarterback who challenges club-goers to foot races, and Alexander Skarsgård portrays a sexually-depraved cannibal. Liam Neeson and Soulja Boy make appearances that reference their 2019 controversial comments and \"Crank That\" dance, respectively.[19] Brian McKnight, Sinbad and Jenna Wortham appear in a mockumentary while Cree Summer features as a drugstore customer.\\n', 'Episodes[edit]', 'Production[edit]', 'FX first began developing the show in August 2013,[20] and then the pilot was ordered to series by FX Networks in December 2014.[21] It was directed by Hiro Murai and shot in Atlanta.[22] It got picked up to series with a ten-episode order in October 2015.[23] Glover, who grew up in Atlanta and also works as a musician, stated that \"the city influenced the tone of the show\".[24]\\n', 'The series is also notable for having an all-Black writing staff, which is virtually unheard of in American television. The writers\\' room consists of Glover himself, his brother Stephen Glover, and members of his rap collective \\'Royalty\\' including Fam Udeorji (Glover\\'s manager), Ibra Ake (Glover\\'s longtime photographer) and Jamal Olori. Stefani Robinson, a writer for Man Seeking Woman, and Taofik Kolade round out the writers\\' room.[25][26] During an interview with The New Yorker, Glover stated the characters smoke cannabis because \"they have PTSD—every Black person does\".[27] The show is shot in 2K resolution, produced and edited by Kyle Reiter and Isaac Hagy, and broadcast on FX in 720p.[28] In January 2017, the series was renewed for a second season; however, FX announced the series would not return until 2018 due to Glover\\'s busy production schedule.[29] Glover revealed that the second season takes inspiration from Tiny Toon Adventures, specifically How I Spent My Vacation.[30]\\n', \"The series was renewed for a third season in June 2018, which was originally planned for a 2019 premiere,[31] but was delayed due to scheduling conflicts.[32] In August 2019, FX renewed the series for a fourth season and announced that the third and fourth seasons would begin filming in early 2020, with each season consisting of eight episodes.[33] In January 2020, FX announced that the third season's episode count was increased to 10 episodes, and that both seasons were planned to air in 2021—season 3 in January and season 4 later that year.[34] Both seasons were also planned to be shot together and that one of the seasons would be filmed outside the United States.[34] However, production was postponed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[35]\\n\", 'In September 2020, it was reported that the third season would not be able to make the January 2021 premiere date that was originally planned.[36] Filming for the third and fourth seasons began in early April 2021, in London, with additional filming in Amsterdam and Paris.[37][38] By August 2021, filming for the third season was completed and production began on the fourth season in Atlanta, and it was confirmed that the third season would premiere in early 2022.[39] The third season premiered with two episodes on March 24, 2022.[40] By February 2022, both seasons three and four had completed filming, and it was announced that the fourth would be the final season.[10]\\n', 'Release[edit]', 'International broadcast[edit]', 'The first season was broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two, from May 13, 2018, to June 17, 2018.[41]\\n', 'Home media[edit]', \"The Complete First Season was released on DVD in Region 1 on March 6, 2018,[42] and The Complete Second Season (Robbin' Season) was released on DVD on December 17, 2019.[43]\\n\", 'Reception[edit]', 'Critical response[edit]', 'Atlanta has received widespread acclaim from television critics. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the first season an approval rating of 98% based on 141 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The website\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Ambitious and refreshing, Atlanta offers a unique vehicle for star and series creator Donald Glover\\'s eccentric brand of humor—as well as a number of timely, trenchant observations.\"[44] On Metacritic, the first season has a score of 90 out of 100, based on reviews from 37 critics.[45]\\n', 'David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave it a highly positive review, writing: \"The scripts for the four episodes made available to critics are as richly nuanced as anything you\\'ll see on TV or, to be sure, in a movie theater. You will not only know these characters after only one episode, you\\'ll be hooked on them, as well. In so many areas, Atlanta sets the bar exceptionally high.\"[52] Sonia Saraiya of Variety also praised the series, declaring it a \"finished, cinematic, and beautiful production that may be one of the best new shows of the fall\".[53]\\n', 'The second season received further critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 98%, based on 212 reviews, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The site\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Donald Glover continues to subvert expectations with a sophomore season of Atlanta that proves as excellent as it is eccentric.\"[46] On Metacritic, the second season has a score of 97 out of 100, based on 28 critics.[47]\\n', 'In 2019, Atlanta was ranked 10th on The Guardian\\'s list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century.[54] The Writers Guild Foundation listed the season 1 episode \"Streets on Lock\" as having one of the best scripts of 2010s film and television, writing, \"The story features fully realized supporting players and miscreants, but right when we start laughing, everything takes a sour turn, causing us to reflect on what we\\'re really laughing at\".[55]\\n', 'The third season has a score of 93 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 24 critics.[49] On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 96%, based on 130 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The site\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Atlanta takes Paper Boi and his entourage out of Georgia, but this inspired third season proves that the more things change, the more they stay weird.\"[48]\\n', 'The fourth season has a score of 82 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 10 critics.[51] On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 98%, based on 119 reviews, with an average rating of 9.0/10. The site\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Foregrounding its characters and namesake again after an anthological sojourn in Europe, Atlanta closes out in its sweet spot: funny, insightful, and weird as hell.\"[50]\\n', 'In 2022, Rolling Stone ranked Atlanta as the ninth-greatest TV show of all time.[12]\\n', 'Accolades[edit]', 'Season 1[edit]', 'Season 2[edit]', 'Season 3[edit]', 'Season 4[edit]', 'References[edit]', '\\n^ Grosinger, Matt (August 12, 2016). \"Donald Glover Shines in the First Trailer for FX\\'s ATLANTA\".

      "['From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia', 'Contents', '2023 Atlantic hurricane season', '\\n', 'The 2023 Atlantic hurricane season was the fourth-most active Atlantic hurricane season on record with 20\\xa0named storms forming,[nb 1] tied with 1933. Among them, 7\\xa0became hurricanes, with 3\\xa0reaching major hurricane strength.[nb 2] The season also had an above‑normal accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of\\xa0148, despite the presence of the 2023–24 El Niño event, which typically results in less activity, and had the most storms for an El\\xa0Niño year on record, largely due to record-warm sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic. The season officially began on June\\xa01 and ended on November\\xa030. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic. However, the formation of subtropical or tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year, as demonstrated by the formation of a subtropical storm on January\\xa016, the earliest start of an Atlantic hurricane season since Hurricane Alex in January 2016.[2] At the time, the system was assessed as non-tropical by the National Hurricane Center (NHC), resulting in it staying unnamed.\\n', \"June saw two tropical storms—Bret and Cindy—form in the tropical Atlantic (south of 23.5°N, east of 60°W) for the first time on record. The former made landfall on Saint Vincent. An unprecedented stretch of activity commenced in late August.[3] Tropical Storm Harold struck southern Texas on August\\xa022, and Hurricane Franklin made landfall in the Dominican Republic as a tropical storm the following day, with the latter reaching peak intensity as a high-end Category\\xa04 hurricane and bringing tropical-storm-force winds to Bermuda. After briefly attaining Category\\xa04 strength on August\\xa030, Hurricane Idalia made landfall in Florida as a Category\\xa03 hurricane. In early September, Hurricane Lee rapidly intensified into a Category\\xa05 hurricane, then later made multiple landfalls in Atlantic Canada as a strong extratropical cyclone. Later that month, Tropical Storm Ophelia made landfall in North Carolina. In October, both Tropical Storm Philippe, the longest-lived tropical cyclone in the Atlantic this year,[4] and Hurricane Tammy made landfall on Barbuda. Also that month, Tropical Depression Twenty‑One made landfall in Nicaragua. With Tammy's dissipation on October\\xa028, the season effectively ended, as no tropical cyclones formed thereafter. The systems of this season collectively produced at least $4.19\\xa0billion (USD)[nb 3] in damage, and caused 20\\xa0fatalities.\\n\", 'Despite the above-normal activity this season, El Niño‑enhanced wind shear prevented most storms from significantly strengthening. Additionally, the El Niño event weakened the Bermuda High, allowing systems to curve northward or take more easterly tracks out to sea, as opposed to being pushed westward towards the continental United States, Mexico, or Central America. As a result, only a few systems impacted land or caused significant damage this season, with just three making landfall in the U.S.[5][6] For the first time since the 2014 season, no names were retired this year by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).[7]\\n', 'Seasonal forecasts[edit]', \"In advance of, and during, each hurricane season, several forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and research groups. More than 25\\xa0forecasts were made for the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season.[29] Among them were forecasts from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Climate Prediction Center, Mexico's Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN), Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), the United Kingdom's Met Office (UKMO), and Philip J. Klotzbach, William M. Gray and their associates at Colorado State University (CSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. According to NOAA and CSU, the average Atlantic hurricane season between 1991 and 2020 contained roughly 14\\xa0tropical storms, seven hurricanes, three major hurricanes, and an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of 74–126 units.[30] Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39\\xa0mph (63\\xa0km/h). NOAA typically categorizes a season as above-average, average, or below-average based on the cumulative ACE index, but the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is sometimes also considered.[8]\\n\", 'Pre-season forecasts[edit]', 'On December\\xa06, 2022, TSR released the first early prediction for the 2023 Atlantic season, predicting a slightly below average year with 13\\xa0named storms, 6\\xa0hurricanes, and 3\\xa0major hurricanes.[10] Their updated prediction on April\\xa06, 2023, called for a similar number of hurricanes, but reduced the number of named storms and major hurricanes by one.[11] The following day, the University of Arizona (UA) posted their forecast calling for a very active season featuring 19\\xa0named storms, 9\\xa0hurricanes, 5\\xa0major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 163\\xa0units.[12] On April\\xa013, CSU researchers released their prediction calling for 13\\xa0named storms, 6\\xa0hurricanes, 2\\xa0major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 100\\xa0units.[31] On April\\xa027, University of Missouri (MU) issued their predictions of 10\\xa0named storms, 4 between categories one and two, and 3\\xa0major hurricanes.[15] On May\\xa01, University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) released their forecast for 12 to 20\\xa0named storms.[16] On May\\xa04, SMN issued its forecast for the Atlantic basin, anticipating 10 to 16\\xa0named storms overall, with 3 to 7\\xa0hurricanes, and 2 to 4\\xa0major hurricanes.[17] On May\\xa025, NOAA announced its forecast, calling for 12 to 17\\xa0named storms, 5 to 9\\xa0hurricanes, and 1 to 4\\xa0major hurricanes, with a 40% chance of a near-normal season and 30% each for an above-average season and a below-average season.[18] One day later, UKMO issued its forecast calling for an extremely active season, with 20\\xa0named storms, 11\\xa0hurricanes, 5\\xa0major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 222\\xa0units.[19]\\n', 'In general, there was a wide range of conclusions among the groups making pre-season forecasts. With regard to number of hurricanes, projections ranged from\\xa05 by SMN to\\xa011 by UKMO. This reflected an uncertainty on the part of the various organizations about how the expected late-summer El Niño event and near record-warm sea surface temperatures would together impact tropical activity.[29]\\n', 'Mid-season forecasts[edit]', 'On June\\xa01, the first official day of the season, CSU issued an updated forecast in which they raised their numbers slightly, now expecting a near-average season with 15\\xa0named storms, 7\\xa0hurricanes, 3\\xa0major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 125\\xa0units. They observed sea surface temperatures in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic had increased further to almost record-highs, which could offset increased wind shear from the impending El Niño.[21] On June\\xa016, UA updated its seasonal prediction, which indicates a very active hurricane season, with 25\\xa0named storms, 12\\xa0hurricanes, 6\\xa0major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 260\\xa0units.[22]\\n', 'On July\\xa06, CSU issued an updated forecast increasing their numbers, predicting a very active season; they now expect 18\\xa0storms, 9\\xa0hurricanes, and 4\\xa0major hurricanes, with an ACE index of 160\\xa0units.[23] The following day, TSR released the first seasonal prediction, predicting a slightly above average year with 17\\xa0named storms, 8\\xa0hurricanes, and 3\\xa0major hurricanes and an ACE index of 125.[24]\\n', \"UKMO updated their forecast on August\\xa01, slightly decreasing the number of tropical storms and hurricanes to 19 and 9, respectively, while increasing the number of major hurricanes from 5 to 6.[25] On August\\xa03, CSU issued their final prediction, with no changes to the amount of tropical storm, hurricanes, and major hurricanes.[26] TSR's last forecast, published on August\\xa08, only adjusted the number of major hurricanes from two to three.[27] Citing record-warm sea surface temperatures, a warm phase of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, and El Niño, NOAA's second prediction, released on August\\xa010, called for 14 to 21\\xa0tropical storms, 6 to 11\\xa0hurricanes, and 2 to 5\\xa0majors hurricanes.[28]\\n\", 'Seasonal summary[edit]', 'Background[edit]', \"Officially, the 2023\\xa0Atlantic hurricane season ran from June\\xa01 to November\\xa030.[32] A total of 21\\xa0tropical cyclones formed, 20 of which intensified into nameable storms,[33] ranking the season as the fourth-most active in terms of number of tropical or subtropical storms, tied with 1933.[3] Of those, seven strengthened into a hurricane, with three systems reaching major hurricane intensity. Thus, the season was above-average compared to NOAA's 1991–2020\\xa0mean of fourteen named storms, while equaling the normal number of hurricanes and major hurricanes, seven and three, respectively.[33] NOAA attributed the abnormally high number of named storms to record-warm sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic, mostly offsetting the effects of a strong El Niño event, which typically limits activity in the basin. In fact, the season had the most tropical or subtropical storms for a year with El Niño conditions present since records began.[34] Meteorologists such as Jonathan Belles and Phil Klotzbach argued, however, that El Niño impacted the season by significantly weakening and shifting the Bermuda high-pressure system eastward, causing several storms to recurve out to sea much farther east than usual or drift aimlessly over the central Atlantic.[35]\\n\", 'Few tropical cyclones in the Atlantic in 2023\\xa0left significant impacts. The most destructive storm, Idalia, caused 12\\xa0deaths and approximately $3.6\\xa0billion in damage in August despite making landfall in Florida at Category\\xa03 hurricane intensity, due to crossing mostly rural areas.[36] During the same month, Franklin rendered at least $90\\xa0million in damage and three deaths, all in the Dominican Republic, which it struck as a weak tropical storm.[37] Although Lee remained offshore while a tropical cyclone, rough seas generated by the storm drowned four people, while the remnants resulted in about $50\\xa0million in damage, mostly in Maine and Atlantic Canada.[38] In September, Ophelia caused approximately $450\\xa0million in damage along the East Coast of the United States.[39] Overall, the storms of the 2023\\xa0season collectively inflicted at least $4.19\\xa0billion in damage and 20\\xa0fatalities.[40]\\n', \"This season's ACE index was approximately 139\\xa0units,[41] roughly 18% above average.[42] This number represents sum of the squares of the maximum sustained wind speed (knots) for all named storms while they are at least tropical storm intensity, divided by 10,000. Therefore, tropical depressions are not included.[8]\\n\", 'In 2023, NOAA logged 468\\xa0flight hours for their Hurricane Hunter missions in the Atlantic. The aircraft deployed more than 1,400\\xa0scientific instruments and conducted 120\\xa0entries into the eye of a storm. NOAA launched several drones, including Black Swift drone for the first time into Tammy, both for obtaining observations and evaluating the efficiency of this method of collecting data. Additionally, NOAA used their aircraft to assist with emergency response to Idalia and Lee, conducting a combined 28\\xa0flight hours to obtain aerial imagery. The National Ocean Service, an agency of NOAA, surveyed just over 42\\xa0mi (68\\xa0km) of coastline, including identifying 29\\xa0potential marine obstructions, in the aftermath of Idalia.[34]\\n', 'Early activity[edit]', \"The 2023 Atlantic hurricane season commenced unexpectedly on January\\xa016, when an unnamed subtropical storm formed off the northeastern U.S. coast then moved over Atlantic Canada.[43] Operationally, the NHC considered the storm to be non-tropical, with minimal likelihood of transitioning into a subtropical or tropical cyclone.[44] A few months later, however, following a post-storm evaluation of the system, it was redesignated as subtropical.[43] No additional tropical or subtropical activity occurred in the basin prior to the official start of the season on June\\xa01. Tropical Storm Arlene formed as a tropical depression on opening day in the Gulf of Mexico. It became the season's first fully tropical storm on June\\xa02, and was assigned the first name on the list, as the January subtropical storm remained unnamed. Later that month, tropical storms Bret and Cindy formed, becoming the first instance of two Atlantic tropical cyclones active simultaneously in June since 1968.[45] The two developed in the Main Development Region (MDR) from successive tropical waves coming off the coast of West Africa.[46] Their formation also marked the first time on record that two tropical storms formed in the MDR during the month of June.[47] Next, Subtropical Storm Don formed over the central Atlantic on July\\xa014. A long-lived storm, it later became fully tropical and strengthened into the season's first hurricane as it meandered around the ocean far from land.[48]\\n\", 'Peak to late activity[edit]', 'Following a lull in activity, tropical cyclogenesis increased drastically in late August. Between August\\xa019 and 21, four depressions formed, which quickly intensified into named storms: Emily, Franklin, Gert, and Harold. Emily formed in the eastern Atlantic, lasting only about 24\\xa0hours before dissipating. Franklin moved across the Dominican Republic as a tropical storm, before intensifying into a Category\\xa04 hurricane in the western Atlantic.[49] Gert became a remnant low on August\\xa022, but regenerated into a tropical depression at the end of the month.[50] Tropical Storm Harold affected south Texas and brought much needed rainfall to the region. Those four were followed by two more systems during last week of the month: Idalia and Jose. Idalia formed on August\\xa026 in the northwestern Caribbean, intensified into a Category\\xa04 hurricane, then made landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida at Category\\xa03 strength. Tropical Storm Jose formed in the open Atlantic on August\\xa029 and remained far from land.[51]\\n', \"The quick pace of storm formation continued into September, the climatological peak of the hurricane season. On September\\xa01, Tropical Storm Katia formed northwest of Cabo Verde in the far eastern Atlantic.[52] After Gert and Katia dissipated, Tropical Storm Lee formed in the central tropical Atlantic on September\\xa05. It became a hurricane a day later, then rapidly intensified to Category\\xa05 strength northeast of the Leeward Islands, with its winds increasing by 80\\xa0mph (130\\xa0km/h) during the 24‑hour period ending at 06:00\\xa0UTC on September\\xa08. Lee later made multiple landfalls in Atlantic Canada after becoming an extratropical cyclone on September\\xa016.[38] Tropical Storm Margot formed next, and strengthened into a hurricane on September\\xa011 while moving through the central Atlantic.[53] They were joined by Hurricane Nigel, which formed midway between the Lesser Antilles and Cabo Verde Islands on September\\xa015. Nigel remained far from any land masses, and became extratropical on September\\xa022.[54] That same day, Tropical Storm Ophelia formed offshore of North Carolina. The storm moved inland the following morning at near-hurricane strength.[39] Also on September\\xa023, Tropical Storm Philippe formed in the eastern tropical Atlantic.[55] Five days later, Tropical Storm Rina developed well east of the Lesser Antilles.

The low quickly organized further, becoming a tropical depression over the eastern Caribbean around 06:00\\xa0UTC on August\\xa020. Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Franklin. Initially moving west-northwestward due to a subtropical ridge, Franklin moved westward and then southwestward on August\\xa021, by which time it began struggling with increasing wind shear. Franklin became disorganized enough that it became difficult to ascertain if the storm still had a closed circulation. Early on August\\xa023, the storm began moving northwestward before turning northward due to a break in the subtropical ridge while becoming more organized as wind shear lessened. Around 10:00\\xa0UTC, Franklin struck Pedernales Province, Dominican Republic, with winds of 45\\xa0mph (75\\xa0km/h).[37]\\n', \"Franklin weakened slightly while crossing the Dominican Republic and emerged into the Atlantic later on August\\xa023. After struggling with strong westerly shear and land interaction for a few more days, Franklin entered a more favorable environment on August\\xa025 and promptly intensified into hurricane on August\\xa026 while turning northwestward. Franklin then rapidly strengthened beginning on August\\xa028, with the storm becoming a major hurricane that day, and then peaking as a Category\\xa04 hurricane with winds of 150\\xa0mph (240\\xa0km/h) early on August\\xa029. However, the system then weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle and wind shear from the outflow of Idalia.[37] Later that day, Franklin turned east-northeastward and passed north of Bermuda. While doing so, the storm's eye structure began to deteriorate due to strong northerly wind shear.[100] Then, on September\\xa01, Franklin transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 720\\xa0mi (1,160\\xa0km) northeast of Bermuda.[37] Three days later, the NHC discussed the potential for the ex‑Franklin, then located north of the Azores, to regenerate as it was expected to soon move southeastward towards warmer waters.[101] Though some reorganization did take place, the extratropical system dissipated on September\\xa09.[37]\\n\", 'The outer bands of Franklin generally produced precipitation total of 2 to 4\\xa0in (51 to 102\\xa0mm) across southern and eastern Puerto Rico, causing mudslides, flash flooding, and overflowing rivers.[102] In the Dominican Republic, Franklin brought heavy rainfall, typically ranging from 6 to 10\\xa0in (150 to 250\\xa0mm) of precipitation, and wind gusts up to 52\\xa0mph (84\\xa0km/h) in Barahona.[37] Consequently, damage occurred to buildings, homes, and light posts.[103] At least 350\\xa0people were displaced, and more than 500 homes and 2,500 roads were affected or damaged.[104] Several communities became isolated, and nearly 350,000\\xa0homes lost electricity and another 1.6\\xa0million residents lost access to potable water.[104] The Meteorological Service of the Dominican Republic reported three deaths in the country, while damage throughout the country totaled approximately $90\\xa0million.

The pace of organization quickened on August\\xa026, with a tropical depression developing at 12:00\\xa0UTC about 45\\xa0mi (70\\xa0km) east-southeast of Cancún, Mexico. Later that day, and into the next, the depression drifted due to weak surrounding steering currents, with its center moving in a small counter-clockwise loop. A brief jog southward moved the depression over Cancún around 06:00\\xa0UTC on August\\xa027. About six hours later, the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Idalia. Early on August\\xa028, Idalia began moving northward toward the Yucatán Channel west of Cuba, intensifying along the way. After passing near the western tip of Cuba early the next, the storm strengthened into a hurricane.[36]\\n', \"Due to warm sea surface temperatures, low wind shear, and moist air, Idalia rapidly intensified as it accelerated northward through the Gulf of Mexico, reaching Category\\xa04 strength early on August\\xa030 and peaking with maximum sustained winds of 130\\xa0mph (215\\xa0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 942\\xa0mbar (27.82\\xa0inHg).[36] Idalia's strengthening was then halted by an eyewall replacement cycle, which caused it to weaken slightly before it made landfall at 11:45\\xa0UTC, near Keaton Beach, Florida, with sustained winds of 115\\xa0mph (185\\xa0km/h).[36][114] Idalia quickly weakened as it moved inland into southeast Georgia, and it was downgraded to a tropical storm at 18:00\\xa0UTC that same day.

Around 12:00\\xa0UTC, while about 60\\xa0mi (95\\xa0km) east of Cape Fear, North Carolina, Idalia transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.[36] The storm then moved slowly eastward and impacted Bermuda with tropical-storm-force winds on September\\xa02, as it passed just to the south. Idalia's remnant low then absorbed Tropical Storm Gert,[96] turned northward, and lingered offshore Atlantic Canada for several days before dissipating on September 8.[36]\\n\", \"During the storm's early stages, heavy rains fell along the Yucatán Peninsula and in western Cuba.[115] Consequently, flooding occurred in some areas of the latter, especially in Artemisa and Pinar del Río provinces, forcing the evacuation of over 10,000\\xa0people. In Florida, high winds and storm surge reaching up to 8 to 12\\xa0ft (2.4 to 3.7\\xa0m) above the ground between Keaton Beach and Steinhatchee caused significant damage across the Big Bend region of Florida to agriculture, infrastructure, and buildings and residences, which were flooded up to several miles inland.[36] Severe storm surge impacts extended southward to parts of the Tampa Bay area, with up to 5\\xa0ft (1.5\\xa0m) of water reported in approximately 2,000\\xa0homes in Pasco County. Roughly 150\\xa0people in the county required rescue during the storm.[116] Tens of thousands of structures in Florida outside the Big Bend region sustained some degree of damage. Parts of Georgia and the Carolinas experienced rains, strong winds, storm surge, and tornadoes, but with lesser impacts than in Florida, while high tides were reported as far north as the Mid-Atlantic. Overall, Idalia caused approximately $3.6\\xa0billion in damage and twelve deaths in the United States – four in Florida, three each in North Carolina and New Jersey, and one each in Georgia and Delaware.[36] The remnants of Idalia caused more than 6,000\\xa0power outages on Bermuda and the delay or cancellation of many flights to and from the L.F.

After traversing the Cabo Verde Islands, a low-pressure area developed on August\\xa024. The disturbance struggled to organize until August\\xa029,[118] when persistent deep convection reignited over the eastern side of the circulation.[119] Consequently, Tropical Depression Eleven formed about 850\\xa0mi (1,370\\xa0km) southeast of Bermuda.[118] The depression meandered due weak steering currents over the next two days, and by August\\xa030, had become less organized due to westerly shear.[120] However, the shear briefly relaxed, and the storm's convective bursting pattern abruptly evolved into curved banding early on August 31, signifying that the depression had strengthened into Tropical Storm Jose.[118][121] Further development occurred slowly as Jose's banding features remained limited, and the convection at its center was shallow.[122] Even so, the storm's structure improved markedly early on September\\xa01 as convection near the center deepened and a small mid-level eye feature appeared, causing Jose to peak with maximum sustained winds of 65\\xa0mph (100\\xa0km/h).[118] This intensification was short lived however, and the storm soon began to weaken due to northerly shear from Hurricane Franklin's outflow.[123] Jose then accelerated northward, pulled by the larger and stronger Franklin,[124] and was absorbed into the latter late that day about 900\\xa0mi (1,450\\xa0km) northeast of Bermuda.[118]\\n\", 'Tropical Storm Katia[edit]', 'On August\\xa029, a tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa.

Developing about 110\\xa0mi (175\\xa0km) west of Santo Antão, the depression moved north-northwestward and intensified into Tropical Storm Katia early on September\\xa02. The storm continued to become better organized throughout the day, peaking with winds of 60\\xa0mph (95\\xa0km/h) around 18:00\\xa0UTC.[52] Shortly thereafter, however, increasing wind shear caused Katia to weaken as its surface center became displaced far to the south of a remnant area of convection.[125] By 00:00\\xa0UTC on September\\xa04, far northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands, the storm had weakened to a tropical depression, six hours before degenerating into a remnant low.

Amid favorable conditions for intensification, the depression quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Lee six hours later and a then a hurricane by late on September\\xa06. Then, during the 24‑hour period ending at 06:00\\xa0UTC on September\\xa08, Lee experienced explosive intensification, and reached Category\\xa05 strength, with its winds increasing by 80\\xa0mph (130\\xa0km/h) to 165\\xa0mph (270\\xa0km/h).[38] However, \\nincreasing southwesterly wind shear quickly caused Lee's eye to become cloud filled and the storm became more asymmetric, weakening it back to a high-end Category\\xa04 hurricane.[127] The pace of weakening quickened as the day progressed, and Lee fell below major hurricane status by late on September\\xa09,[38] according to data from an evening hurricane hunters mission revealing that the storm was undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle and still being adversely affected by wind shear.[128]\\n\", \"By September\\xa010, wind shear abated, permitting the new, larger-diameter eye to contract and to grow more symmetric.[129] As a result, Lee intensified to Category\\xa03 strength once again that same day. Another series of eyewall replacement cycles led to fluctuations in its size and intensity, but Lee remained a major hurricane throughout. After tracking west-northwestward to northwestward for much of its trans‑Atlantic journey, Lee turned northward on September\\xa013, moving around the western side of the steering subtropical ridge. That same day, it also weakened to Category\\xa02 strength.[38] Then, on the morning of September\\xa014, Lee became a Category\\xa01 hurricane while approaching Bermuda,[130] which it passed to the west by 185\\xa0mi (300\\xa0km) later in the day.[131] As the hurricane pushed northward, continued drier air entrainment and increasingly strong southerly wind shear displaced Lee's convection to the northern side of the system, weakening it further. These factors caused the hurricane to commence its extratropical transition,[132] which was completed by 06:00\\xa0UTC on September\\xa016. Later that day and throughout the next two days, the extratropical cyclone made several landfalls in Atlantic Canada before moving into the northern Atlantic and merging with another extratropical low late on September\\xa018.[38]\\n\", 'Rip currents caused one fatality in Puerto Rico when a 66-year old man drowned at Poza del Obispo. Additionally, Lee generated dangerous surf and rip currents along the entire Atlantic coast of the United States. Strong winds with hurricane‑force gusts left extensive power outages in the U.S. state of Maine, and in the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Three storm-related fatalities occurred in the mainland of the United States: a 15-year-old boy drowned in Fernandina Beach, Florida; a 50-year-old man died in Searsport, Maine, when a tree fell onto the car he was in; and a 21-year-old man who was killed in Manasquan Inlet, New Jersey when the boat he was in capsized and sunk due to a tall wave.[38]\\n', 'Hurricane Margot[edit]', \"A tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa into the eastern tropical Atlantic on September\\xa05.

Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Margot.[53] Initially, northerly shear and dry mid-level air intrusion slowed organizational improvements, though bursts of deep convection and a diffluent outflow pattern beginning on September\\xa09 allowed for some intensification to occur.[134] Margot reached hurricane status by September\\xa011,[53] based on an eye that was becoming more defined and improvements to the storm's overall structure.[135] It continued along a north to north-northwest track for a few days, exhibiting a double eyewall with a well-defined inner core and reaching winds of 90\\xa0mph (150\\xa0km/h) on September\\xa013.[53] Caught in weak steering currents by a building mid-level ridge to its north, Margot drifted east-southeastward as it began to make a clockwise loop. Upwelled cooler waters due to Margot's slow motion and large amounts of dry air caused it to weaken to a tropical storm on September\\xa015.[136] After convection became increasingly farther from the center,[137] Margot degenerated into a remnant low about 715\\xa0mi (1,150\\xa0km) southwest of the Azores late on September\\xa016.

At the same time, increasing southwesterly wind shear began causing an elongation of Nigel's cloud pattern, resulting in further weakening.[147] Nigel also encountered sea surface temperatures falling below 68\\xa0°F (20\\xa0°C),[148] leading to an extratropical transition northwest of the Azores early on September\\xa022.[54]\\n\", 'Tropical Storm Ophelia[edit]', 'On September\\xa017, the NHC first noted the potential for tropical cyclone development near the southeast coast of the United States in its seven-day outlook.[149] A broad non-tropical low formed on September\\xa021, aided by the presence of a mid- to upper-level trough moving off the Southeastern United States. By late the following, the low shed its frontal characteristics and acquired more deep convection and tropical storm-force winds, leading to the development of Tropical Storm Ophelia. Early on September\\xa023, the cyclone peaked with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 981\\xa0mbar (29.0\\xa0inHg). Ophelia then made landfall around 10:15\\xa0UTC near Emerald Isle, North Carolina, about 25\\xa0mi (40\\xa0km) west-northwest of Cape Lookout.

The low associated with Ophelia dissipated over Maryland on September\\xa024, while the remnants meandered offshore the Mid-Atlantic for a few more days,[39] until being absorbed by another nearby low.[150]\\n', \"States of emergency were declared in Virginia, North Carolina, and Maryland ahead of the storm.[151] Five people aboard an anchored catamaran near Cape Lookout, North Carolina, had to be rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard due to deteriorating conditions as the storm approached.[152] Floodwaters inundated communities and roadways along the Atlantic seaboard from North Carolina to New Jersey.[151][152][153] The highest storm surge was 3.67\\xa0ft (1.12\\xa0m) above mean sea level at Sewell's Point, Virginia.[153] Tropical storm‑force winds, as well as wind gusts up to 75\\xa0mph (121\\xa0km/h) at Southport, North Carolina,[39] downed trees and power lines and caused sporadic property damage along its path,[152][154][155] while also leaving about 70,000\\xa0homes without electricity in eastern North Carolina and Virginia combined.[39] Heavy rain also fell along the East Coast of the United States, with up to 9.51\\xa0in (242\\xa0mm) of precipitation near Greenville, North Carolina. Ophelia and its remnants caused about $450\\xa0million in damage.[39] On September 28–29, the low which had absorbed Ophelia's remnants stalled offshore, causing heavy flash flooding in the New York metropolitan area.[150][156]\\n\", 'Tropical Storm Philippe[edit]', \"On September\\xa020, a tropical wave moved offshore West Africa and into the Atlantic. The wave developed into a low-pressure area by the next day, which organized into Tropical Depression Seventeen roughly 1,550\\xa0mi (2,495\\xa0km) east of Barbados on September\\xa023. Later that day, the depression became Tropical Storm Philippe and continued to strengthen due to warm waters and light to moderate wind shear while moving westward along the southern side of a mid-level ridge. After reaching winds of 60\\xa0mph (95\\xa0km/h) early on September\\xa025, Philippe encountered stronger wind shear, causing the center to become exposed.[157] Between September\\xa027 and September\\xa028, the cyclone nearly stalled and moved north-northwestward before curving southwestward due to the aforementioned ridge being replaced by another one and the close proximity of Rina. Philippe's slowed motion allowed for some re-intensification, again reaching winds of 60\\xa0mph (95\\xa0km/h) late on September\\xa030. However, wind shear soon stripped convection away from the center again by the next day. On October\\xa02, the storm turned northwestward and struck Barbuda at 22:45\\xa0UTC with winds of 50\\xa0mph (85\\xa0km/h), before passing near the Virgin Islands the next day. Philippe turned northward on October\\xa04, and weakened some due to wind shear. The storm briefly re-strengthened on October\\xa05 due to interaction with a trough. However, the trough also generated a non-tropical low, which absorbed Philippe around 12:00\\xa0UTC on October\\xa06 about 175\\xa0mi (280\\xa0km) south of Bermuda.[157]\\n\", \"In Guadeloupe, some areas were left without running water, and 2,500\\xa0power outages occurred.[157] The storm also washed out roads, caused mudslides, damaged multiple schools, and dropped up to 16.41\\xa0in (417\\xa0mm) of precipitation at Vieux-Fort.[157][158] Floodwaters inundated several homes and vehicles in Antigua and Barbuda.[159] A fire ignited due to a lightning strike produced by Philippe burned down several buildings at a yacht club.[157] Off the United States Virgin Islands, 12\\xa0people were rescued after a ship started to submerge in rough seas.[160][161] Bermuda experienced some strong winds and rain but reported only minor damage.[157] A cold front and Philippe's remnants combined to bring up to 6\\xa0in (150\\xa0mm) to parts of Maine on October\\xa07 and October\\xa08.[162] Gusts in the state were in the 50–60\\xa0mph (85–95\\xa0km/h) range,[163] while many locations in Atlantic Canada reported gale-force winds.[157] The CCRIF made payouts for excess rainfall totaling US$3.4 million after the storm. [164]\\n\", 'Tropical Storm Rina[edit]', \"Between September\\xa022 and September\\xa023, a tropical wave crossed the west coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic.[165] A broad area of low pressure formed the next day,[166] and the showers and thunderstorms within this disturbance began showing signs of organization a couple days later.[167] Early on September\\xa028, the system organized into Tropical Storm Rina about 1,000\\xa0mi (1,610\\xa0km) east-northeast of Barbados.[165] The next day, Rina's wind field became slightly larger and stronger.[168] But it only intensified for a brief time, peaking with winds of 50\\xa0mph (85\\xa0km/h) before weakening on account of strong northeasterly wind shear and dry mid-level air.[165][169] Rina became devoid of organized deep convection early on October\\xa01, and its surface circulation became increasingly ill-defined during the day.[170] Consequently, the system degenerated into a remnant low around 18:00\\xa0UTC about 670\\xa0mi (1,080\\xa0km) southeast of Bermuda. The remnant low dissipated early on October\\xa02.[165]\\n\", 'Tropical Storm Sean[edit]', 'On October\\xa05, a potent low-latitude tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa. Dry air and vertical wind shear initially hindered tropical cyclogenesis. However, environmental conditions began improving on October\\xa09, leading to the formation of a tropical depression about 525\\xa0mi (845\\xa0km) southwest of the southernmost Cabo Verde Islands late the next day. The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Sean early on October\\xa011.[57] However, Sean remained a highly sheared storm and weakened back to a tropical depression several hours later.[57][171] Around 12:00\\xa0UTC on October\\xa012, Sean re-strengthened into a tropical storm, shortly before peaking with winds of 45\\xa0mph (75\\xa0km/h).[57] Little additional organization occurred; by early on October\\xa014, convective bursts became intermittent and fairly short-lived, and the storm weakened once more to a tropical depression.[57][172] Thereafter, Sean degraded slowly, lingering for a day and a half before becoming a remnant low on October\\xa015 about 970\\xa0mi (1,560\\xa0km) east of the Leeward Islands. The low continued slowly west-northwestward before dissipating late the next day.[57]\\n', 'Hurricane Tammy[edit]', 'A well-defined tropical wave entered the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa between October\\xa09 and October\\xa010. The wave developed a low by October\\xa011 while passing through the Cabo Verde Islands, but dry air and strong wind shear caused it to struggle to organize further until October\\xa017. By then, persistent convection formed, gradually leading disturbance to organize into Tropical Storm Tammy late on October\\xa018 roughly 575\\xa0mi (925\\xa0km) east of the Lesser Antilles. The storm steadily strengthened while moving west-northwestward, becoming a hurricane late on October\\xa020. Tammy then moved northwestward and north-northwestward for the next few days due to a steering ridge being forced eastward as a result of a trough exiting the East Coast of the United States. During this time, the hurricane remained very close to the Lesser Antilles and struck Barbuda with winds of 90\\xa0mph (150\\xa0km/h) at 01:15\\xa0UTC on October\\xa022.[58] After pulling away from the Leeward Islands that day, Tammy weakened to a minimal hurricane while struggling against wind shear.[173]\\n', \"By October\\xa025, however, Tammy began to strengthen while interacting with an upper-level trough and later that day peaked as a Category\\xa02 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110\\xa0mph (175\\xa0km/h).[58] Shortly after Tammy reached peak intensity, a cold front to the north,[174] a drier air mass, and an increase in wind shear diminished the cyclone's convection and caused it to weaken to a tropical storm early on October\\xa027. Though the storm became significantly asymmetrical, it maintained a warm core. Tammy then turned eastward along the northern periphery of a subtropical ridge and briefly re-developed more convection, but degenerated into a remnant low late on October\\xa028 about 470\\xa0mi (755\\xa0km) east-northeast of Bermuda. The remnant low opened into a trough over the central Atlantic late on October\\xa031.[58]\\n\", 'Barbuda and Antigua both received minimal damage, though blackouts occurred across both islands. At least two families on Barbuda had to be evacuated.[59] Among the islands of Guadeloupe, only La Désirade experienced hurricane-force winds.[175] There were no reports of serious storm damage.[176] Rainfall amounts across the Leeward Islands were between 4 and 8\\xa0in (100 and 200\\xa0mm), and storm surge heights were between 1 and 3\\xa0ft (0.30 and 0.91\\xa0m).[177] Bermuda was impacted with wind gusts of 40\\xa0mph (65\\xa0km/h).[178]  After the storm, the CCRIF made payouts for Excess Rainfall to St. Kitts and Nevis totaling US$1,509,804 (2023 USD).[179]\\n', 'Tropical Depression Twenty-One[edit]', 'An area of disturbed weather within the eastern Pacific monsoon trough developed into a broad low-pressure area over the far southwestern Caribbean on October\\xa022. The low quickly acquired more deep convection and a well-defined circulation, signaling the formation of a tropical depression at 12:00\\xa0UTC on the next day roughly 80\\xa0mi (130\\xa0km) east of southern Nicaragua. However, no intensification occurred prior to the depression making landfall in Nicaragua near Pearl Lagoon in the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region at 01:30\\xa0UTC on October\\xa024 with winds of 30\\xa0mph (45\\xa0km/h). By 12:00\\xa0UTC, the depression degenerated into a remnant low, which dissipated shortly therafter near Rosita.[180] The remnants of the depression crossed over Central America and contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Pilar in the Eastern Pacific.[181]\\n', 'The depression produced 3 to 5\\xa0in (76 to 127\\xa0mm) of rain over southeastern Nicaragua, with some locally higher totals, including 5.13\\xa0in (130\\xa0mm) of precipitation in Bluefields over a 48-hour period. Despite heavier rains, there were no visible reports of damages or casualties from the system.[180]\\n', 'Other system[edit]', 'A broad area of low pressure formed over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November\\xa014.[182] The disturbance became more organized on November\\xa016. Satellite images and data gathered during a U.S. Air Force Reserve hurricane hunter flight showed that the system had a closed yet elongated circulation, but there was not a well-defined low level center. At 21:00\\xa0UTC on November\\xa016, the NHC designated the system Potential Tropical Cyclone Twenty-Two.[183] The system was unable to organize further due to persistent high wind shear, and only produced near gale-force peak winds of 30–35\\xa0mph (45–55\\xa0km/h).[184] At 03:00\\xa0UTC on November\\xa018 the NHC issued their final advisory on the system, then located between Cuba and Jamaica, after it seemed likely that the disturbance would neither develop nor produce tropical storm-force winds.[183]\\n', 'Though tropical cyclogenesis was stifled, the disturbance generated intense thunderstorms spreading over southeastern Central America and across a wide swath of the Greater Antilles.[185] The latter region recorded heavy rainfall, with up to 12.42\\xa0in (315\\xa0mm) of precipitation in Jamaica and 19\\xa0in (480\\xa0mm) in the Dominican Republic. In Jamaica, flooding forced the rescue of 24\\xa0people, while about 24,000\\xa0customers lost electricity as heavy precipitation downed trees and power lines and caused mudslides. The disturbance left at least three people dead in Haiti. Between November\\xa017 and November\\xa019, the Dominican Republic Emergency Operations Center rescued over 2,500\\xa0people. Flooding damaged several bridges and roads and over 2,600\\xa0homes, while 17\\xa0were destroyed. A total of 21\\xa0fatalities occurred in the Dominican Republic.[183]\\n', 'Storm names[edit]', \"The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 2023.[186] This was the same list used in the 2017 season, with the exceptions of Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel, which replaced Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate, respectively.[187] Each of the new names was used in 2023 for the first time. This season's list will be used again in 2029, as no names were retired from it afterwards. This was the first season since 2014 to not have a name be retired.[7]\\n\", 'Season effects[edit]', 'This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, intensities, areas affected, damages, and death totals.

       "'The \"knights of the shire,\" also known as \"knights of the shire and county,\" were a key part of England\\'s parliamentary system in the medieval and early modern periods. These knights were representatives elected by the landowning, or \"freeholder,\" population of each shire (county) to serve in the Parliament of England, particularly in the House of Commons. Here are some key points about them:\\n\\n1. **Historical Background**: The tradition of electing knights to represent shires dates back to the 13th century during the reign of King Edward I. Specifically, it is often associated with the Model Parliament of 1295, which called for representatives from each shire and borough.\\n\\n2. **Role in Parliament**: The primary function of the knights of the shire was to represent the interests of their shires in the House of Commons. They played a crucial role in discussing and consenting to taxes and legislation that affected the realm.\\n\\n3. **Eligibility and Election**: Originally, to be eligible for election as a knight of the shire, a candidate needed to be a substantial landowner, typically a knight by social status, though not necessarily knighted. In early years, all freeholders who held land worth at least 40 shillings annually (a significant amount at the time) could vote in these elections. \\n\\n4. **Representation**: Each shire typically sent two knights to Parliament, although this number could vary. Some larger or more significant counties had more representation.\\n\\n5. **Impact on Governance**: The inclusion of knights of the shire in Parliament marked a significant development in English governance, reflecting broader representation beyond the nobility and clergy. Their participation underscored the increasing importance of commoners (albeit still a wealthy and influential subset) in the legislative process.\\n\\n6. **Evolution Over Time**: Over the centuries, the role and influence of the knights of the shire evolved, especially as parliamentary democracy further developed. By the time of the reforms in the 19th century, like the Reform Act 1832, the nature of representation and electoral systems had become more complex and inclusive, changing the landscape of parliamentary representation.\\n\\nThe knights of the shire played a foundational role in the development of a more representative and structured parliamentary system in England, contributing to the gradual evolution of more democratic forms of governance.'"
