Trees are a type of plant that have a trunk, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit. The trunk is covered in bark, which protects the tree, and is made of wood, which provides support and is a valuable resource. Branches grow from the trunk and have leaves, which are usually green. Leaves use sunlight for photosynthesis to produce food for the tree. Flowers are the reproductive part of the tree and contain petals. Fruit grows from the flowers and contains seeds, which are also used for reproduction. The roots of the tree grow underground in the soil and absorb water and nutrients for the tree.
