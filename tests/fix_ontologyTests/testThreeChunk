Bicycles, cars, and motorcycles are all types of vehicles. Bicycles have two wheels and are powered by humans using pedals. Cars have four wheels and use a motor that runs on gasoline. Motorcycles also have two wheels and a motor, but are smaller than cars. The rider controls a bicycle with handlebars, while a driver controls a car with a steering wheel. The motor in a car or motorcycle converts the chemical energy in gasoline to mechanical energy to move the vehicle. All of these vehicles are commonly used for personal transportation.
