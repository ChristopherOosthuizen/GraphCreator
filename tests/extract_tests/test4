While these renewable sources have lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to burning coal or natural gas, they also have some environmental impacts. Manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines requires mining raw materials like metals and rare earth elements. Large hydroelectric dams can disrupt river ecosystems and displace local communities. 

To address the intermittency of solar and wind power, energy storage solutions like batteries or pumped hydro are used to store excess energy during peak production times and release it when needed. Smart grids and demand response programs help balance electricity supply and demand. Government policies such as renewable portfolio standards, feed-in tariffs, and tax incentives have accelerated the deployment of renewables.

Despite challenges, the falling costs and improving efficiency of renewable technologies, coupled with the urgent need to address climate change, are driving a global transition towards cleaner energy sources. Integrating higher shares of renewables will require significant investments in transmission infrastructure, energy storage, and grid modernization. A mix of solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and other technologies can provide a reliable, low-carbon electricity supply. Energy efficiency measures and electrification of transport and heating will also play key roles in reducing overall energy demand and emissions.```
