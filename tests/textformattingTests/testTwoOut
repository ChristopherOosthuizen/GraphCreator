The Tate Modern is a modern art gallery located in London, England. It is Britain's national gallery of international modern art and forms part of the Tate group together with Tate Britain, Tate Liverpool and Tate St Ives. It is based in the former Bankside Power Station, in the London Borough of Southwark. Tate holds the national collection of British art from 1900 to the present day and international modern and contemporary art.
The galleries are housed in the former Bankside Power Station, which was originally designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, the architect of Battersea Power Station, and built in two stages between 1947 and 1963. The power station closed in 1981. In 1992 The Tate Gallery at Millbank was renamed Tate Britain and a competition was launched to convert the disused power station for the Tate collection of modern art. The winning entry was by Pritzker Prize-winning architects Herzog & de Meuron, and it opened as Tate Modern in 2000.
The collections in Tate Modern consist of works of international modern and contemporary art dating from 1900 until today. Tate Modern includes modern British art where it contributes to the story of modern art, so major modern British artists may be found at both Tate Modern and Tate Britain.
Tate Modern is one of the largest museums of modern and contemporary art in the world. As with the UK's other national galleries and museums, there is no admission charge for access to the collection displays, which take up the majority of the gallery space, whereas tickets must be purchased for the major temporary exhibitions. The gallery attracted 5.25 million visitors in 2012.
