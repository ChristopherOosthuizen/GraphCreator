augment ontology graph adding relevant concept relationship triplets keeping original intact Identify important concepts relationships not original ontology add new triplets new nodes use standard terminology generic labels describe semantic relationships between concepts Aim for clarity specificity Add new triplets to existing JSON list alphabetical order "n1" field readability Preserve original ontology triplets even redundant goal produce augmented ontology graph key context avoiding tangential irrelevant concepts create bridgeless graph with many triangles priority create many relevent triplets output expanded ontology same JSON list format original each dictionary representing semantic link between two concepts
