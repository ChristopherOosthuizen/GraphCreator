Task: Ontology Fusion
Given a set of ontology chunks represented as lists of node-edge-node triples separated by newlines, your task is to combine these ontologies through knowledge fusion. This involves:
Preserving all original nodes and edges from the input ontologies in the combined result ontology.
Adding new nodes and edges that semantically link concepts across the originally separate ontology chunks.
Linking two nodes means creating a new edge between them that represents a semantic relationship or connection. This relationship should be meaningful within the context of the domain and help to integrate the knowledge from the separate ontology chunks into a cohesive whole. The edge label should clearly and concisely describe the nature of the relationship.
For example, if one ontology chunk has the node "car" and another has "vehicle", you might add a new edge linking them with the label "is a type of", since a car is a specific type of vehicle. Similarly, if one chunk mentions "engine" and another "car", you could link them with an edge like "is a part of", indicating that an engine is a component of a car.
When deciding which nodes to link and how, consider the following guidelines:

Identify concepts that are semantically related or share a common category, even if they come from different input ontologies.
Use edge labels that accurately capture the relationship between the nodes in a specific and unambiguous way.
Aim to create a connected graph by linking nodes across the input ontology chunks, but avoid adding edges that are redundant or less informative.
If needed, introduce new nodes that serve as bridges or umbrella terms to link disparate concepts and improve the overall ontology's coherence and conciseness.

The input will be provided in the following JSON-like format:
Ontology Chunk 1:
[
{"node_1": "Concept 1A", "node_2": "Concept 1B", "edge": "relationship label 1"},
{"node_1": "Concept 1B", "node_2": "Concept 1C", "edge": "relationship label 2"}
]
Ontology Chunk 2:
[
{"node_1": "Concept 2A", "node_2": "Concept 2B", "edge": "relationship label 3"},
{"node_1": "Concept 2C", "node_2": "Concept 2D", "edge": "relationship label 4"}
]
Ontology Chunk 3:
[...]
Context Chunk:
[Original text from which the ontology chunks were derived]
Your task is to output a single unified ontology that fuses knowledge from the separate input chunks, in this format:
[
{"node_1": "Original concept 1", "node_2": "Original concept 2", "edge": "Original relationship label"},
{"node_1": "Previously isolated concept", "node_2": "Existing concept it connects to", "edge": "New semantic relationship linking them"},
{"node_1": "Another original concept", "node_2": "Related original concept", "edge": "Original relationship label"},
{"node_1": "New bridging concept", "node_2": "Existing concept it helps link", "edge": "Relationship connecting distant parts of the graph"},
{...}
]
The output ontology should contain all original nodes and edges, as well as a number of additional nodes and edges you generate to link concepts across the originally separate ontology chunks. The goal is to produce a unified knowledge representation that connects the chunks through new semantic relationships. Be sure to output the result using the specified JSON-like format. Do not add a comment like "// new semantic relationships linking concepts across chunks:" Just output the unified ontology.
