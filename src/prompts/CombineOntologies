Task Ontology Fusion ontology chunks as node-ed-node triples separated by newlines, task combine ontologies through fusion involves Preserving original nodes eds in combined result ontology Adding new nodes eds link concepts across separate chunks Linking two nodes creating new ed semantic relationship relationship meaningful context domain integrate into cohesive whole ed label should describe nature relationship, one ontology chunk "car" another "vehicle", add new ed with label "is type of", car vehicle, one chunk mentions "engine" another "car", link with ed "is part of", engine component of car deciding nodes link, consider guidelines Identify concepts semantically related common category, different ontologies Use ed labels capture relationship Aim create connected linking nodes across, avoid adding eds redundant or less informative If, introduce new nodes umbrella terms link disparate concepts improve ontology coherence conciseness
The input will be provided in the following JSON-like format:
Ontology Chunk 1:
[
  {"n1": "C1A", "n2": "C1B", "ed": "rel1"},
  {"n1": "C1B", "n2": "C1C", "ed": "rel2"}
]
Ontology Chunk 2:
[
  {"n1": "C2A", "n2": "C2B", "ed": "rel3"},
  {"n1": "C2C", "n2": "C2D", "ed": "rel4"}
]
Ontology Chunk 3:
[...]
Context Chunk:
[Original text from which the ontology chunks were derived]
Your task is to output a single unified ontology that fuses knowled from the separate input chunks, in this format:
[
  {"n1": "Orig1", "n2": "Orig2", "ed": "OrigRel"},
  {"n1": "Isolated", "n2": "Existing", "ed": "NewRel"},
  {"n1": "AnotherOrig", "n2": "RelatedOrig", "ed": "OrigRel"},
  {"n1": "NewConcept", "n2": "LinkedConcept", "ed": "ConnectingRel"},
  ...
]
output ontology contain original nodes eds, additional link concepts across separate chunks goal unified representation chunks new semantic relationships output result using JSON-like format add comment like new semantic relationships linking concepts across chunks output unified ontology Input:
