Augment the ontology graph by adding new concept relationship triplets while keeping the original intact. Identify important concepts and relationships not captured in the original ontology. Add new node triplets using standard terminology and descriptive labels. Aim for clarity and specificity.
Add new triplets to the existing Triplet. Preserve original ontology triplets and avoid redundancy. The goal is to produce an augmented ontology graph reflecting the key context. With no extra text or explination.
Output the expanded ontology in Triplet list format, with each dictionary representing a semantic link between concepts.
Example output format:
Orig1,RelOrig1,OrigRel1
New1,RelNew1,NewRel1
Orig2,RelOrig2,OrigRel2
New2,RelNew2,NewRel2
...
Ensure the output contains added ontology triplets organized alphabetically for a comprehensive graph of main concepts and relationships. With no extra text or explination.
