Fuse ontology chunks by combining node-ed-node triples. Preserve original nodes and edges while adding new links to connect concepts across chunks. Focus only on producing the triplets with no additional explanation or text. Input format:
Chunk 1:
C1A,rel1,C1B
C1B,rel2,C1C
Chunk 2:
C2A,rel3,C2B
C2C,rel4,C2D
Chunk 3:
...
Output a single unified ontology in this format:
Orig1,Orig Rel,Orig2
Isolated,New Rel,Existing
Another Orig,Orig Rel,Related Orig
New Concept,Connect Rel,Linked Concept

You are also given a list of shorthands for various named entities inside the text. If a triplet requires the use of one of these entities, replace it with the shorthand; if there is no shorthand, use the entire entity name.
ShortHands:
<shorthands>
Ensure the unified ontology includes:
- Original nodes and edges.
- New semantic relationships linking concepts across chunks.
- Do not add extra lines or have intermediate lines that say thinkgs like chunk1 or chunk2: just output the entire ontology as one
- Output in Triplet-like format
