Task: Ontology Fusion
Given a set of ontology chunks represented as lists of node-ed-node triples separated by newlines, your task is to combine these ontologies through knowled fusion. This involves:
Preserving all original nodes and eds from the input ontologies in the combined result ontology.
Adding new nodes and eds that semantically link concepts across the originally separate ontology chunks.
The input will be provided in the following JSON-like format:
Ontology Chunk 1:
[
{"n1": "Concept 1A", "n2": "Concept 1B", "ed": "relationship label 1"},
{"n1": "Concept 1B", "n2": "Concept 1C", "ed": "relationship label 2"}
]
Ontology Chunk 2:
[
{"n1": "Concept 2A", "n2": "Concept 2B", "ed": "relationship label 3"},
{"n1": "Concept 2C", "n2": "Concept 2D", "ed": "relationship label 4"}
]
Ontology Chunk 3:
[...]
Your task is to output a single unified ontology that fuses knowled from the separate input chunks, in this format:
[
{"n1": "Original concept 1", "n2": "Original concept 2", "ed": "Original relationship label"},
{"n1": "Previously isolated concept", "n2": "Existing concept it connects to", "ed": "New semantic relationship linking them"},
{"n1": "Another original concept", "n2": "Related original concept", "ed": "Original relationship label"},
{"n1": "New bridging concept", "n2": "Existing concept it helps link", "ed": "Relationship connecting distant parts of the graph"},
{...}
]
The output ontology should contain all original nodes and eds, as well as a number of additional nodes and eds you generate to link concepts across the originally separate ontology chunks. The goal is to produce a unified knowled representation that connects the chunks through new semantic relationships. Be sure to output the result using the specified JSON-like format. Do not add a comment like "// new semantic relationships linking concepts across chunks:" Just output the unified ontology.
