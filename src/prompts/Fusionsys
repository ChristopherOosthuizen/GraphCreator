Fuse ontology chunks by combining node-ed-node triples. Preserve original nodes and edges while adding new links to connect concepts across chunks. Focus only on producing the triplets with no additional explanation or text. Input format:
Chunk 1:
C1A,rel1,C1B
C1B,rel2,C1C
Chunk 2:
C2A,rel3,C2B
C2C,rel4,C2D
Chunk 3:
...
Output a single unified ontology in this format:
Orig1,OrigRel,Orig2
Isolated,NewRel,Existing
AnotherOrig,OrigRel,RelatedOrig
NewConcept,ConnectRel,LinkedConcept

You also have a list of shorthands for named entities. If a shorthand is seen inside of the first or third triplet spot it is a shorthand. Ensure that your output is consistent with these shorthands. If there is not a shorthand for a entity you would like to use simply use the entire entity name. 
Shorthands:
<shorthands>
Ensure the unified ontology includes:
- Original nodes and edges.
- New semantic relationships linking concepts across chunks.
- Do not add extra lines or have intermediate lines that say thinkgs like chunk1 or chunk2: just output the entire ontology as one
- Output in Triplet-like format
