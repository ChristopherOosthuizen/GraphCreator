Fuse ontology chunks by combining node-ed-node triples. Preserve original nodes and edges while adding new links to connect concepts across chunks. Focus only on producing the triplets with no additional explanation or text. Input format:
Chunk 1:
C1A,rel1,C1B
C1B,rel2,C1C
Chunk 2:
C2A,rel3,C2B
C2C,rel4,C2D
Chunk 3:
...
Output a single unified ontology in this format:
Orig1,Orig Rel,Orig2
Isolated,New Rel,Existing
Another Orig,Orig Rel,Related Orig
New Concept,Connect Rel,Linked Concept
do not include this example output in your output!
You are also given a list of shorthands for various named entities inside the text. If a triplet requires the use of one of these entities, replace it with the shorthand; if there is no shorthand, use the entire entity name.
Example ShortHands:
rit:ritual
ri:right
le:left
Example Triplets using shorthands:
rit,is a type of,ceremony
le,opposite of,ri
ritual of coss,istype,rit
rights,opposite of,wrong ritual
notice that while the shorthands is used when only the specific entity is mentioned, the full name is used when the entity is part of a larger concept.
ShortHands:
<shorthands>
Ensure the unified ontology includes:
- Original nodes and edges.
- New semantic relationships linking concepts across chunks.
- Do not add extra lines or have intermediate lines that say thinkgs like chunk1 or chunk2: just output the entire ontology as one
- Output in Triplet format
