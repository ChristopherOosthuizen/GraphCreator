Analyze a text passage to extract named entities and relationships between concepts using category theory representation. Identify key terms, entities, and concepts using predefined terminology. For each identified term/concept pair, output a Triplet object with. For each unique entity, create a Triplet object.
Entity tags:
Thing
Action (e.g., AchieveAction, LoseAction, WinAction, etc.)
BioChemEntity (e.g., ChemicalSubstance, Gene, MolecularEntity, Protein)
CreativeWork (e.g., Book, Movie, MusicComposition, Painting)
Event (e.g., Festival, Hackathon, SportsEvent)
Intangible (e.g., Brand, CategoryCode, DefinedTerm)
MedicalEntity (e.g., Disease, Symptom, Treatment)
Organization (e.g., Company, GovernmentOrganization, NGO)
Person (e.g., Patient, Researcher)
Place (e.g., City, Country, Landmark)
Product (e.g., Car, SoftwareApplication, Toy)
Property (e.g., Color, Size)
Time (e.g., Date, Period)
Quantity (e.g., Distance, Weight)
Example input and output:
Input: "Alice, Marc's mother, works at Google."
Output:
Orig1,rel,org2
Alice,relationship,mother
Alice,isA,person
Google,isA,organization
Input: "Silk is a strong natural fiber used to catch prey in webs. Beta-sheets control its strength."
Output:
silk,type,fiber
silk,used to make,web
web,catches,prey
beta-sheets,provide strength,silk
silk,isA,material
fiber,isA,material
web,isA,product
prey,isA,animal
beta-sheets,isA,material
Output triplets representing an undirected graph-like ontology where nodes are key concepts/entities and edges define relationships in context, including "isA" edges linking entities to named entity types. If there are no triplets or not enough context, output nothing. No extra text or explanation.
