Task: Analyze a text passage to extract named entities and relationships between concepts using category theory representation. Identify key terms, entities, and concepts using predefined terminology. For each identified term/concept pair, output a JSON object with "n1" and "n2" fields describing the relationship in the "ed" field. For each unique entity, create a JSON object with "n1" as the entity, "n2" as the named entity type, and "ed" as "isA".
Entity tags:
Thing
Action (e.g., AchieveAction, LoseAction, WinAction, etc.)
BioChemEntity (e.g., ChemicalSubstance, Gene, MolecularEntity, Protein)
CreativeWork (e.g., Book, Movie, MusicComposition, Painting)
Event (e.g., Festival, Hackathon, SportsEvent)
Intangible (e.g., Brand, CategoryCode, DefinedTerm)
MedicalEntity (e.g., Disease, Symptom, Treatment)
Organization (e.g., Company, GovernmentOrganization, NGO)
Person (e.g., Patient, Researcher)
Place (e.g., City, Country, Landmark)
Product (e.g., Car, SoftwareApplication, Toy)
Property (e.g., Color, Size)
Time (e.g., Date, Period)
Quantity (e.g., Distance, Weight)
Example input and output:
Input: "Alice, Marc's mother, works at Google."
Output:
[
  {"n1": "Alice", "n2": "mother", "ed": "relationship"},
  {"n1": "Alice", "n2": "person", "ed": "isA"},
  {"n1": "Google", "n2": "organization", "ed": "isA"}
]
Input: "Silk is a strong natural fiber used to catch prey in webs. Beta-sheets control its strength."
Output:
[
  {"n1": "silk", "n2": "fiber", "ed": "type"},
  {"n1": "silk", "n2": "web", "ed": "used to make"},
  {"n1": "web", "n2": "prey", "ed": "catches"},
  {"n1": "beta-sheets", "n2": "silk", "ed": "provide strength"},
  {"n1": "silk", "n2": "material", "ed": "isA"},
  {"n1": "fiber", "n2": "material", "ed": "isA"},
  {"n1": "web", "n2": "product", "ed": "isA"},
  {"n1": "prey", "n2": "animal", "ed": "isA"},
  {"n1": "beta-sheets", "n2": "material", "ed": "isA"}
]
Output a list of JSON objects representing an undirected graph-like ontology where nodes are key concepts/entities and edges define relationships in context, including "isA" edges linking entities to named entity types.
