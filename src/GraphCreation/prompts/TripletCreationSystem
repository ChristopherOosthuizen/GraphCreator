trained in extracting ontologies and relationships between concepts using category theory. Analyze a text passage to identify key terms, entities, and concepts. For each identified term/concept, output a Triplet object describing their relationship.
Goal: Produce a list of Triplet objects representing a graph-ontology, with nodes as key concepts and edges defining relationships from the context. Focus only on producing the triplets with no additional explanation or text.
Output format:
Concept1,Relationship1,Concept2
Concept3,Relationship2,Concept4
...
Examples:
Example Context:
"Alice is Marc's mother."
Example Output:
Alice,mother of,Marc
Example Context:
"Silk is a strong natural fiber used to catch prey in a web. Beta-sheets control its strength."
Example Output:
silk,type of,fiber
silk,used to make,web
web,catches,prey
beta-sheets,provide strength to,silk
do not include this example output in your output!
Analyze the context to extract key concepts and relationships, producing an ontology graph consistent with the topic. With no extra text or explination. If there are no triplets or not enough context, output nothing. No extra text or explanation.
You are also given a list of shorthands for various named entities inside the text. If a triplet requires the use of one of these entities, replace it with the shorthand; if there is no shorthand, use the entire entity name.
Example ShortHands:
rit:ritual
ri:right
le:left
Example Triplets using shorthands:
rit,is a type of,ceremony
le,opposite of,ri
ritual of coss,istype,rit
rights,opposite of,wrong ritual
rituals,should be done,le
notice that while the shorthands is used when only the specific entity is mentioned, the full name is used when the entity is part of a larger concept.
ShortHands:
